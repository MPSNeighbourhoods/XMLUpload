Drug dealing is being reported by dog walkers frequently in the bushes off the main path in the greenway, Hayes. this is usually young males dealing to class A users who hide in the under growth.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-27</issue-date><action>Officers have been undertaking proactive policing and joint work with councillors and the council to combat violent crime across the ward. 

Officers routinely work alongside the council in days of action along the Oxbridge parade of shops which is the location of many violent altercations. This has led to many anti-social behaviour tickets being issued banning individuals from these locations and stop searches to combat weapon carrying. 

The ward has also acted fast time with intel around gang members having offensive weapons inside their properties. This led to two (2) large machete knives being removed from high risk gang members and other knife related arrests. 

Officers are routinely identifying locations of high violence and sexually motivated crimes against women and targeting these proactively and with a community focus and will continue to do so.

The proactive policing of the park has also been highly successful. Officers managed to arrest the NGANG drug runner operating this drug line which removed the issue. However, anti-social behaviour is still relevant officers have been working to gain intelligence and work with partner teams to conduct warrants on those involved. </action><action-date>2023-07-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 1 - ASB in Communal Spaces.</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-27</suggestion-date><issue>Anti social behaviour caused by youths loitering in communal spaces is proliferating in namely MONTREAL HOUSE, OWEN CLOSE and AYLES ROAD.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-27</issue-date><action>This priority has been managed through various streams. The first being proactive policing in and around problem areas at problem times changing shifts accordingly. This led to the main offenders being issued with criminal protection warnings not to be in any communal spaces they do not reside, preventing this issue from occurring. 

The second is working with the council CCTV and ASB team. Officers on the ward completed extensive research and collated a list of all CAD and crime reports from this location and lobbied this to the council to get CCTV in the vicinity. This is awaiting an update. 

Officers have also been successful with getting lighting fitted at the end of MELROSE CLOSE, HAYES which has been a repeat issue over the past two (2) years.</action><action-date>2023-07-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft from Motor Vehicles</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-27</suggestion-date><issue>SHAKESPEARE AVENUE and BALMORAL DRIVE had a spate of theft from motor vehicles.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-27</issue-date><action>This is an issue which has recently come to the forefront in a specific location within the ward. This led to officers completing an extensive letter drop to the entire road. These letters explained about reporting any intelligence or suspicions, but also how to protect houses and vehicles from being broken into and stolen. 

further to this, officers have created a photo board of all frequent offenders of theft so that on patrol they can be approached and dealt with accordingly. 

Alongside the above, officers have been changing shifts to accommodate key times of theft and targeted a location whereby moped theft is proliferating. Over the working week, the suspected offenders were stopped numerous times and dealt with for varying offences and a location/address was identified whereby the offenders could be hiding. Furthermore, large amounts of tools and items to steal said vehicles were recovered at the location and dealt with accordingly. 

This location is now routinely policed when on shift.</action><action-date>2023-07-27</action-date></priority></priorities>

Measurable – Police reports like Plan Web and SNT Analytics measure both non and residential burglary.  They accurately show where and when the offences happened on the ward and predictive maps can produce hotspot patrol areas.

Attainable – This will be attained by a mixture of high visibility and plain clothes patrols in and around drug hotspots on the ward.  We will utilise social media and cocooning to alert residents of potential hotspots and target local burglary nominal on the ward.

Relevant – The ward panel members have considered this a priority for some time and always want police to treat it as such.  Measurable statistics and intelligence support this.

Currently over the summer of 2021, there has been very few reports of ASB at Kings hill avenue which is mainly due to the redevelopment work that has been carried out along the parade of shops. Once this has been completed it is anticipated that ASB may return – as a number of new benches have been installed, which historically attract street drinkers to loiter in the area. 

Begging – the main culprit for begging at the shops is a Kevin BIDMEAD and his son Stephen. Kevin has been issued with a CPN  (expires 01/04/2022) and Stephen has been issued with a CPW (expire 04/12/2022) preventing them from begging on Kings hill Ave. At present, we have not received any further reports of begging, although 1 report was received that he was outside the shops but no evidence of begging. A number of the local shop  owners know that they have been issued with CPN / CPWs and they will report if they are seen etc.  
</issue><issue-date>2023-08-02</issue-date><action>Safer Neighbourhood Team  officers conduct regular foot patrols along the parade of shops in order to combat any disturbance or ASB.

ASB is continuously monitored and any intelligence/information is recorded.</action><action-date>2023-08-02</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2022-11-23</suggestion-date><issue>SERIOUS YOUTH VIOLENCE
S – Colville has seen several incidents of serious violence involving youth as well as wider BS gang tensions. 
M – VOLT and SARA analysis to be carried out, they can accurately show where offences have occurred. Gain support and work with YET and Youth Clubs in the area and deliver awareness. Gain intel packages on known offenders
A – A mixture of Hi – Viz and plain clothed patrols on the ward, weapon sweeps, Intel led warrants to target prolific known offenders, outside resources like TSG, VCTF and mounted to assist in targeted patrols of the ward, stop and search. 
R – This a relevant to Colville due to the mixture of gangs in close proximity to each other and the violent crimes occurring on the ward. There is a real potential for the loss of confidence between the police and the community and must be treated as a priority.
T- To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting. </issue><issue-date>2022-11-23</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2022-11-23</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2022-11-23</suggestion-date><issue>S - To reduce drug offences and drug related ASB on Portobello Road.
M.  Drug offences like possession and supply can be measured by looking through crime reports and stop and search records for the ward, intel / CAD reports and complaints through Airspace and Partners. Approach will be to Apply VOLT P/S model to this area. Where offenders identified consider Achilles heel tactics.
A – Create a bespoke development plan based on Intel from victim type, location and suspect descriptions. Create an operational plan based on the Intel with enforcement to be considered by way of CBO's for Prolific Offenders.
R – Portobello Road has a high profile street market coupled with a high number of eating and drinking establishments. This attracts high footfall of local and visitors to the area and is a prime target for drug dealers to operate. ASB associated with this could also be a potential for violence on the ward.

PROBLEM: Anti-social report of youths congregating in COLLIERS WOOD RECRETIONAL GROUND. Residents make reports of ASB but have not stated what the youths congregating are doing, no mention of drug taking but state they are intimidated. Reports of Eastern European MALES drinking alcohol behind the shrubs in the WANDLE PARK (behind TESCO, COLLIERS WOOD HIGH STREET). They often leave rubbish. 

SOLUTION: COLLIERS WOOD no longer has a PSPO (Public spaces protection order) and therefore no fines are issued but when officers patrol the area where drinkers are being a nuisance, ASBW is issued. WANDLE PARK has been highlighted due to the amount of positive drugs stop and search conducted. High visibility patrols in the area to deter congregation at the location.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-12</suggestion-date><issue>DRUGS
The main areas of concern for reducing drug dealing and taking of miss-used substances are THE SIGERS, AZALEA WALK, PEMBROKE PARK ESTATE and all alleyways in and around the areas 

Eastcote officers conduct regular Hi Viz patrols at the location and surrounding areas to prevent these activities from happening and arrest offenders if offences are present. Officers do plain clothes patrols and work in conjunction with the local residents to combat these crimes. 

Long term plan is to reduce the drugs problem in the local area by continuing to work with local resident and other agencies to combat drugs offences. 

This is one of Eastcote's ward priority's set by the local residents from the live survey submitted online

This priority is reviewed at each quarterly ward panel meeting</issue><issue-date>2023-04-12</issue-date><action>We have been actively patrolling these areas to deter drug dealing in these areas. We have also held street briefings in these areas to speak to residents.</action><action-date>2023-04-12</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Anti Social Behaviour</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-12</suggestion-date><issue>Eastcote Ward during the Autumn months sees a large uplift in the youths congregating in the open spaces/parks especially Warrender Park and Field end road causing anti-social behaviour such as letting off fireworks and dressing up in Halloween costumes to put others in fear.  
Begging on Field end road has also been highlighted as a concern.

Local neighbourhood officers conduct regular Hi-Viz patrols in and around these areas and work alongside several other departments such as neighbourhood tasking teams to try and ensure lots of high visibility patrols are completed and individuals are dealt with accordingly to tackle the ongoing issue
Officers look at dates and times when these offences are being committed to have high visibility patrols at the affected areas present to deter anyone committing any offences and deal with any other offences at the time. 

This a ward priority set by local residents which gets reviewed at every quarterly meeting and may change depending on the review of offences reported against other crimes 

Regular review is carried out by officers and feedback given to local residents of what officers have done via messages on social media platforms.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-12</issue-date><action>We have conducted high visible patrols in these areas to tackle the issue.</action><action-date>2023-04-12</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Violence Against Women and Girls</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-12</suggestion-date><issue>Concerns have been raised at the recent ward panel around areas on the ward where women have felt unsafe walking.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-06-23</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and drugs - Feltham Park
Tackle drugs activity and robberies in and around the area of Feltham Parks and look to reduce and prevent it where possible.
The team were able to identify a group of three robbers who were subsequently arrested and charged. We then stopped and detained a different group of three other robbers who were also arrested. 
There were a large number of gang nominal who had recently been travelling to Feltham Parks and loitering there in groups. They have been selling both class A drugs as well as cannabis and are armed with large hunting knives. We have focused our efforts on identifying as many nominal involved in this activity as possible to help us build accurate and useful intelligence and have arrested subjects when it has been safe to do so.
Most recently one of the males arrested is now currently in prison after an arrest by the team, another was arrested when found with class A drugs and a third was arrested for weapons offensives. 
The team is also utilising CBOs, CPNS and ASB warning notices to disrupt these gang nominal by restricting which locations they can visit and who they can associate with, which so far is proving to be effective.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-23</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-06-23</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Antisocial behaviour in North Feltham</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-06-23</suggestion-date><issue>The team will focus their efforts in reducing antisocial behaviour on the ward by identifying groups and individuals involved in causing this.

Reports of motorcycles being ridden antisocially have reduced considerably. The team still patrol the areas where these are likely to be used.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-23</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-06-23</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-08</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and burglary
To reduce incidents of Robbery and burglary in the Earl’s Court area.
Measurable: the incidences of robbery and burglary can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, and ASB reports relating to robbery and attempted robbery.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by the continuation of high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, vehicle patrols, variation of shifts to include late and night shifts, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening. We also provide crime prevention advice and engagement via social media. Earl’s Court SNT officers regularly change their shifts to combat robbery and burglary, and conduct stop and search where grounds exist.  Robbery and burglary patrols are conducted on the Earls Court Road and surrounding streets. The Earls Court ward panel members are often given crime prevention advice regarding knife point robberies.   
Plain clothes operations can be considered with neighbouring wards to further disrupt robbery if need be.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-08</issue-date><action>SNT conduct regular proactive patrols around the ward at all times of the day.

Measurable: this can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, intelligence reports, and ASB reports relating to drugs, as well as the anecdotal evidence seen by officers, WP members and local residents.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by a combination of high-visibility patrols within the highlighted area, joint working with RBKC wardens officers, robust enforcement of PSPO legislation and effective use of CPW/CPN to  offenders. Earl’s Court officers have been proactive in obtaining two very successful warrants recently, recovering approx. £30,000 of drugs. Drug users have reported that the area is currently ‘too hot’ for drugs and they are going elsewhere. Local drug users are regularly stopped and searched, leading to a number of arrests and community resolutions. The drug hotspots in Earls Court are around Nevern Square, Nevern Place, Trebovir Road and Templeton Place. These areas are patrolled when officers are on duty. Further drug warrants are planned to combat the supply of drugs in Earls Court.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-08</issue-date><action>SNT approach drug issues using a multi pronged approach.

This priority is aimed at reducing the street robberies in and around the Winstanley Estate area. In particular, any streets or public greens such as York Gardens which serve as a thoroughfare for commuters egressing from Clapham Junction who may find themselves as victims of personal robbery, in particular during the hours of darkness later in the year.
Ongoing patrols where our late turn shifts allow serve as a good point to deal with this.
In addition, utilising support from other resources and teams such as the new Neighbourhood Tasking Team, and the Territorial Support Group will assist us in dealing with such issues.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-05</issue-date><action>Research of intelligence system to identify locations for patrols and potential offenders.

This is not bespoke to one particular area of our ward, instead it is found to exist in multiple areas across Latchmere.
Will will map out each crime using Met Insights / PlanWeb, and using this data, we will be able to work out hotspots and as such, co-ordinate patrols effectively.
When at each hotspot, and circumstance permitting, good use of Stop and Search, and where applicable, good use of the information sharing agreement with the council may assist in dealing with those most troublesome.
ASB comes in many form - such as, noise disturbances from addresses engaged in drug dealing, loitering in and around these areas thus putting neighbours in fear of harm, urination / defecation in stairwells and other public access areas of buildings, graffiti. The list is non exhaustive.
Where we identify addresses that are causing ASB issues and where drugs are the nucleus, we can use ASB powers to good use - such as Closure Orders under Section 80 of the ASB Act of 2014.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-05</issue-date><action>High Visibility patrols to the locations identified to deter those committing Anti-Social Behaviour.

Subsequently, these mopeds are used to commit crimes. We aim to disrupt this activity by carrying out targeted patrols. Using any intelligence gained from open or closed sources, and utilising local knowledge, we will work to address this problem.
Though it is not a large problem on our ward, the theft of catalytic converters is nevertheless an issue. When the analytics are viewed on PlanWeb, we normally see a spike in the winter months. It is hoped that campaigns such as Autumn Nights and Winter Nights will serve as a deterrent for any would-be opportunists.
In order to deal with the theft-from element, we will utilise social media by putting out reminders to owners of vehicles to lock it and secure it.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-17</suggestion-date><issue>Violence Against Women and Girls - This is a top priority for the ward and we are keen to work with the community in order to achieve our goal. It is also a top priority for the Commissioner, Sir Mark ROWLEY who is committed to what we call '' precise community crime fighting''. He opined that we will work out our approach to problems with the communities impacted - not impose solutions on them. It is in this light that we will be engaging with our community, relying on them for information and intelligence and making sure that suspects are prosecuted.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>We are aware that trust in the police has gone down taking into consideration recent happenings but we are prepared to rebuild that trust. We will treat every intelligence seriously and help victims in every step of the way to get justice.</action><action-date>2023-04-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Speeding and Traffic</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-17</suggestion-date><issue>Speeding is a major problem in Grove Park with special reference to major roads such as Winn Road, Baring Road, Burnt Ash Hill, Marvels Lane, Le May Avenue, Chinbrook Road and part of Grove Park Road. The traffic in Somertrees Avenue is another major concern where motorists have been speeding and aggressively forced their way through in a hurry to get to Le May Avenue and unto Baring Road. Signages  as to who has priority are absent on this road. This is something we have brought to the attention of the council. </issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>In terms of problem solving, we have been conducting speed gun  operations on several occasions but what we lack is the ability to levy fines on motorists. We have emphasised countlessly that fines will serve as a deterrent and the council should also endeavour to install cameras on these roads. Another week of action for speed gun operation is planned for October.</action><action-date>2023-04-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB)</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-17</suggestion-date><issue>ASB is an ongoing issue that can be mitigated through problem solving and patrolling hotspot areas. Most of the problems regarding ASB are between neighbours and can be settled through mediation and on several occasions we have involved other agencies such as housing associations and the council using a joint-up approach.
ASB is also perpetrated  by individuals involved in drug taking, noise nuisance and rowdy behaviour. This is mainly carried out in stairwells of block of flats and communal areas/gardens.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>We have been increasing patrols in open spaces such as parks and we intend to utilise 10 hour shifts to conduct plain clothes policing in certain areas at some point.</action><action-date>2023-04-17</action-date></priority></priorities>

• Conduct weapon sweeps in different areas of the High Street and alleyways including the Moxon Street
• Conduct plain-clothes patrols
• Liaise with Tasking team and make them aware as well to pay attention to this location if and when they can during their patrols.
• Liaise with neighbouring SNT team to work together to tackle ASB issues.

High Barnet Team plan to reduce burglaries on the above-mentioned roads. These roads are selected from the Intel we have received from 'plan web' and from 'Cris (crime by Beat Search).' Plan web has identified these roads as hotspots areas on our ward.

The aim of this priority is:
1.	To reduce crime figures on these roads
2.	Improve crime prevention awareness to residents
3.	Reduce repeat victims 
4.	Target and identify regular offenders (active burglars IOMs)

We will achieve this by:
1.	Burglary patrols within the hotpots areas
2.	Carry out Street briefings; contact points; High Viz events in hotspot areas to deter burglars
3.	Carry out Victim visits to provide crime prevention advice and reassurance to prevent repeat victims
4.	Use social media platforms to get out crime prevention advice and raise awareness
5.	Identify suspects and IOMs on the ward</issue><issue-date>2023-07-04</issue-date><action>A CPNW was issued to the landowner at the end of DEC 22 by Barnet Council for direction to secure the site.

- How we will do this: 
1. Patrols of the open spaces within the ward where violent crime has taken place more often.
2. Dealing with UME's when they appear on the ward. 
3. Engage with local residents and business. 
5. Attention to the pubs/clubs especially over the weekend. 
6. Organise 'walk along’ s' with local social groups in the area to further increase our engagement.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-05-27</suggestion-date><issue>
Our first priority, which arguably is the most important, remains to tackle violence in our ward, which is the most prevalent offence taking place. For example, from August 2021 to October 2021  we had 62 reports of Violence against the person, which in large part is due to the gradual ease of lock down restrictions which started in July 2021. During this time we have increased our footpatrols across Norbury Park, specifically in the hot spot areas of Green Lane where we had 3 cases , Beulah Hill 3 cases, Westminster road 3 and 2 in Biggin hill. The next three months from November 2021 through to January 2022 we have seen a significant decrease in reports of violence against the person, which in part, is helped by our increased police presence and return to the norm after national lockdown.
Offences related to violence has been reported which include domestic assault, Domestic abuse and violence on the street. These number incluing violence involved injury and non injury. Patroling in known hot spot areas that are cause for concern on our Ward is the first priority of local patroling team.</issue><issue-date>2023-05-27</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-05-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft of and Theft From Motor vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-05-27</suggestion-date><issue>Most of the Theft from motor vehicles in our ward concerns theft of catalytic converters, which is our main focus with regards to vehicle related crime, not only in this ward but across Croydon as a whole, which remains a big issue.  SNT Norbury Park is engaging in proactive patrols and delivering valuable advice to victims of crime relating to theft of MV. By educating the public on how to make their cars safer, whether that be with a dash cam, steering wheel lock and our increased police presence, we hope to reduce catalytic converter theft.  From August 2021 to October 2021 we had 20 reports for Theft from Motor Vehicle and we had 19 report of theft of motor vehicle including TWOC. The majority of crimes where this takes place has been reported in the area of Beulah Hill and Green Lane.
The next three months from November 2021 through to January 2022 we have seen a significant increase to 13 reports.</issue><issue-date>2023-05-27</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-05-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drug Offences, possession and PWITS</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-05-27</suggestion-date><issue>
We have been conducting patrols to gather intelligence related to drug use, as well as targeting the supply of drugs. Currently we have started several new operations, aiming towards the effective use of warrants, targeting the most prevalent criminals in relation to drug supply with the objective of using warrants as our main tool to catch these criminals involved in PWITS. For example, from August 2021 to October 2021 we had 9 reports of drug offences and the next three months from November 2021 through to January 2022 we have seen a significant decrease in 11 reports. we are aware of that there are some  spots that we prioritize more due to more issues involved,  than again in green lane 2, Craignish Avenue 1, Buckingham 1, Biggin Way 1, London road 1 and Beulah Hill 1.</issue><issue-date>2023-05-27</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-05-27</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-13</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERIES
S. To reduce the amount of robberies on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of robberies happen near to Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road. This is due to residents/non-residents attending the area and visiting local bars and restaurant’s. Members of public are then normally targeted walking home from venues in off streets from the main roads.

A. Though Plain Cloths operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. A mobile CCTV camera has been requested from the council and placed on the junction of Old Brompton Road and Drayton Gardens to tackle the issue. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Creswell Place and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. Robberies appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. 

T. To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting on the 10th Jul 2023.

To reduce the amount of motor vehicle crime on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of vehicle crimes happens near to Chelsea and Westminster hospital. This is due to non-residents coming into the area. Overnight Crimes reveal a steady amount of TFMV across the ward. This usually increases on Match days when Chelsea are seen to play and those travelling to the ward from off borough to park their cars. 

A. Though Plain Clothes operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. Signage from the council is being requested to tackle the issue, along with arranging for hedges and trees to be trimmed to give cameras a clear view. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Hollywood Road and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. TFMV appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. Areas to be reviewed as to where suitable and most beneficial for CCTV.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-06-23</suggestion-date><issue>Priority 1: Violence VAQA23251
This is the MPS priority set in the ward panel on 24/06/2023 for a period of 3 months.
The team will specifically address edged weapons and made offensive weapons as part of the priority. This will include weapon sweeps, the use of stop search under section 1 PACE and section 60 CJPO when available.
Warrants will be sought when intelligence about made offensive weapons is identified to utilise newer legislation to tackle this.
Violence is a significant problem, the Rayners Lane Estate which houses members of the Rayners Lane Gang and there are ongoing tensions with NGANG, this is therefore relevant.
All encounters of weapon enabled crime with SNT intervention will be recorded and all stop search or warrants.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-23</issue-date><action>Rayners Lane SNT PC's and PCSO have conducted regular mobile and foot patrols across the ward during various times of the day. We have completed daily weapons sweeps at various locations especially at hot spots, such as service roads on ALEXANDRA AVENUE and concealed staircases.
 
Operation GOODRICH: Local ward officers have been patrolling RAYNERS LANE STATION to engage with girls and women to make them aware about the VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) and issue literature, give advice and encourage women and girls to report any unsafe streets on STREET SAFE</action><action-date>2023-06-23</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-06-23</suggestion-date><issue>Priority 2: Theft from motor vehicle VAQA23252

This is a ward panel priority and follows a trend of this offence type being committed in the ward.
The team will attend all allegations of theft of motor vehicle as part of a follow up visit for any resident who has had an offence committed and resides within the ward.
The team will complete door to door enquiries for each offence, complimenting investigations held by other officers.
The team will review CCTV, in an attempt to identify linked series offences.
Linked series offences will be allocated to one of the team to progress and deal with offenders.
Criminal behaviour orders will be requested for any linked series offences investigated by the team to introduce long term solutions. This will be achieved through regular review of overnight crimes across the ward and patterns being identified where they exist.
Acquisitive crime has the ability to significantly impact significant cross sections of the community and often is attributable to a few offenders. This activity will be recorded over the period of 3 months and reviewed at the next ward panel meeting.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-23</issue-date><action>The team have attended and completed follow up visits to all victims of theft from motor vehicle who reside within the ward.

Drugs dealing one of the biggest fast spreading crime not only in Harrow but almost everywhere.

My plan is to reduce Drugs related crime in Rayners lane ward by Regular Foot-Patrols on the HOT-SPOT areas where suspicious people congregate to undue reasons. 

Engage with the local business owners especially Bookmakers, off-license shops and also with the residents to maintain the report to get as much as Intel.
Encourage people to report it to police if the see any suspicious activities around them with as much as detail possible e.g.  Height, colour, age, clothing, car make and colour with VRM etc.
This can be dealt with the relevant intelligence from residents or businesses, for that SNT will make more engagements with ward residents via street briefings, sent out regular messages on OWL and ACE. SNT team will encourage residents to report each and every suspicious activities to police with the relevant information’s like Day/date and times, VRMs, description of the suspects, clothing etc. and then SNT will increase foot and vehicle patrols in reported area. 

The team will identify areas of substance abuse and use police tactics and powers to reduce this activity.
</issue><issue-date>2023-06-23</issue-date><action>The team have responded to numerous strands of information in relation to both drug use and drug supply. We have built these locations into our routine patrols and where appropriate, have used search powers under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

The team have been developing intelligence around drug supply in an attempt to target offenders for drug supply, this continues to progress.</action><action-date>2023-06-23</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-26</suggestion-date><issue>Serious youth violence continues to be a priority for the ward officers. Although there have been very few incidents of this recently there were many in the past and we do not want to return to this! Whilst the incidents have been rare in the past few years it does occasionally raise its head but the ward officer’s determination, dedication and knowledge has had a great effect on keeping a lid on this and improving the quality of life for the residents. The SNT officers sometimes use local resources to work in partnership with, in order to address any incidents or concerns as well as local partners including Westminster housing, local charities, schools and local leaders to prevent any further incidents.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-26</issue-date><action>Officers patrol regularly on the Churchill Gardens estate, providing a high visibility presence and reassurance for the residents- someone they can speak to about any concerns. The team also work closely with the youth club on the estate and engage with the young residents. They conduct regular weapon sweeps to reduce storage of weapons and the location is dependent on the recent intelligence received. 
The use of community protection notices and other disposal options continues to be a great way of keeping a check on this.</action><action-date>2023-04-26</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Groups of Youths</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-26</suggestion-date><issue>Residents in the Churchill Gardens estate have told Local Officers that they have seen an increase in anti-social behaviour on the estate committed predominantly by youths who reside on the ward or the surrounding wards. This anti-social behaviour recently has been committed in the communal areas predominantly in Meadow Garden and Chippendale House. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted high visibility patrols on the estate in the relevant blocks to firstly act as a deterrent but also to be there to witness and speak to those who are engaging in this anti-social behaviour and other activities such as spitting and cannabis smoking. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. The local ward officers have worked hard to improve this issue and although there are incidents they are decreasing in frequency, this is helped due to the officer’s personal approach as they know most of the youths and the use of CPN's etc.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-26</issue-date><action>The actions the officers will take to address this priority is to continue their high visibility patrols in the communal areas and those that are impacted by this anti-social behaviour. They will continue to issue community protection notices and warnings where appropriate and engage with both the youths and their families to dissuade them from repeating certain behaviours. The Meadow garden and Chippendale house will be targeted for the next few months and will then be re-assessed.</action><action-date>2023-04-26</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB caused by the street population</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-26</suggestion-date><issue>Residents in St George’s Square and the surrounding residential streets have informed Local Officers that they have seen an increase in problems relating to drug taking and misuse in the square. They were concerned that drug dealing groups are coming into the area from other parts of South London and selling to the vulnerable individuals that live in the local hostels and to the street population who are drawn into the area by the appeal of Victoria station. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted patrols over the next three months specifically looking at this issue. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. Officers will be receiving support from other internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London. This work will also be supported by the area based Violence Suppression teams who can add extra numbers and skills to impact of resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-26</issue-date><action>Local officers will address this issue by conducting regular patrols in the hotspot areas on the ward to act as a deterrent to the behaviour and also to address an anti-social behaviour or drug activity that they witness by means of community protection warnings or notices that target behaviours such as begging, littering and general ASB in the area. They will engage with other MET resources to provide more support and attention to the area and to engage and deal with individuals they find engaging in drugs or drug- related activity in the area. Local officers are also working with partner agencies to support the vulnerable individuals impacted by drug use and the related anti-social behaviour but they are also increasing their focus on disrupting drug supplies and dealings in the area by means of applying for warrants to seize drugs, to conduct stop and searches where grounds exist and take appropriate action such as arrest, the seizure of drugs and other disposal options will be considered. Officers engage in both uniformed patrols and plain clothes operations to target hotspot areas. Local officers also engage with both the staff and the residents of the hostels that are in the vicinity of the ward and the local street population to address the anti-social behaviour that they engage with and the impact it has on residents.</action><action-date>2023-04-26</action-date></priority></priorities>

Residents have had issues with unknown people congregating near 15 Hammond Road. 
M - SNT have been carrying out hi-visibility as well as plain clothes patrols along with other ward teams to deter those involve as we as initiate arrests, stop and searches, etc.
A – Location of HAMMOND ROAD, SOUTHALL has been on the policing radar over the last few weeks collectively. Residents as well as members of the public have reported it to the police that one particular address on this street if the primary source kinked to drugs as well as ASB. Residents have also raised complaints of drugs use, drug dealing and general ASB. This is one of the ward priorities and ward officers as well other teams including NTT have been requested to carry out patrols along this are to curtail, identify and deter people from engaging in drug related ASB. Emphasis are laid on stop and searched wherever grounds exists. An initiative with the local authority is currently being worked on.
R - This priority is relevant in relation to the existing problem. 
T – The proposed plan of action will be initiated alongside other ward matters.
SNT officers have been conducting re-assurances as well as hi-visibility patrols at this hotspot along with engaging with residents as well as members of the public to establish further lines of enquiry and information. </action><action-date>2023-03-03</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion></suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-03-03</suggestion-date><issue></issue><issue-date>2023-03-03</issue-date><action>S - Reduce drug related ASB and violence based crimes in and around the hotspot. 
M – This hotspot has been a matter of concern given the recent GBH where victims are known or have affiliations to gangs. SNT have been conducting plain clothes as well as uniformed patrols to identify and deter those involved. 
A Over the last six months, there have been several incidents linked to serious violence thereby causing GBH level injuries to the victim. Although on almost every occasion the victims have declined to substantiate the allegation or have refused to provide details or description of the alleged suspects, intelligence states this might be linked to gang related violence over drugs or previous incidents. This is yet to be confirmed. SNT officers along with the ward sergeants have been working on having Op Nomad cameras to monitor, identify and further plan operations targeting those involved in violent crimes. This operation would be in collaboration with other ward teams as well as NTT.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-09</suggestion-date><issue>One of the ward’s priorities is related to violence, to look at where it occurs on the ward and how local officers can prevent and address it. Violent crimes on Pimlico North are rare but perceived violence is common which can be contributed to the fact that Victoria train station is on the ward and there is a large number of street population around. Local officers aim to decrease this perceived violence by increasing high visibility patrols when they are in and with the use of extra resources within the MET such as the territorial support group, the violence suppression unit, mounted branch and working with British Transport Police. This partnership work with other units will decrease and discourage actual and perceived violence on the ward and increase confidence by targeting areas with high footfall. This will be achievable by SNT officers being visibly seen and available to patrol the areas stated, to deter the crime and also addressing any anti-social behaviour. As a ward who has a high percentage of residents living across the ward the priority is relevant to make the residents and neighbourhoods feel safe.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-09</issue-date><action>
Officers will increase their high visibility patrols on the ward to deter crime and address anti-social behaviour that is deemed intimidating by residents. Officers will also have joint operations with the British transport police to address violent crimes that occur in and around Victoria Station, they will also hold crime prevention stalls in the station on a more frequent basis.</action><action-date>2023-07-09</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Concentrating on Street Population and the area around Victoria Train Station.</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-09</suggestion-date><issue>This is very similar to priority 1. ASB is low in the area and when it does occur, it is often attributed to the street population around the Lillington and Longmore estate and around Victoria train Station. Last quarter this had spread to adjacent areas but concentrated patrols appears to have reduced this. However reports of drug taking in private gardens and cellar areas still raises it head. Begging, drug taking, drug paraphernalia, rubbish being left are all symptoms of the street population and will be targeted by local officers. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. We will be receiving support from our Local Policing teams such as The Violence Suppression unit and Gangs Unit, who can add extra numbers and skills to have an impact on resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-09</issue-date><action>Heightened patrols will take place at targeted times and locations in order to target the issue. The use of community protection notices will continue, targeting those engaging in anti-social behaviour. We will work alongside our partners, including the VBID, Homeless charities and above all, Hopkinson House. Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any signs of potential drug dealing, no matter how small it may seem. If any community members would also like to be part of a walk-along patrol to discuss this issue, please use the contact forms on this site. Local officers  will continue to work with  both internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London and other police forces such as the City of London Police and British Transport Police to conduct joint operations focusing on areas known as drug hotspots and attempting to disrupt county lines. Drug Dealers will also continue to be our prime target.</action><action-date>2023-07-09</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft of mail</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-09</suggestion-date><issue>Pimlico North had 17 crimes reported in the last 3 months, where victims have been targeted for their phones. Unsuspecting victims have their phones in their hands and suspects, usually on bikes or electric scooters, come up to them and snatch their phones from them. They then make off at speed. With their faces covered up, CCTV is often of no use in identifying these offenders.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-09</issue-date><action>This requires a 2 pronged attack. Education of victims and detection of suspects. Police need to raise awareness that this crime is occurring in this area. This can be done by speaking to members of the public who are seen with their phones out. Leaflets can be distributed and left in key positions as well as posters displayed in stores and coffee shops. Officers will increase patrols in key areas and at key times in an attempt to detect offenders. Both uniformed and plain clothes patrols utilising bikes as well as utilising stop and search will help detect and prevent offences.</action><action-date>2023-07-09</action-date></priority></priorities>

Based on police reporting systems and officer local knowledge, the local SNT will be doing targeted patrols along Broad Lane Junction with High Road Tottenham to South Tottenham Station.

This offered re-assurance to the residents and they were confident that officers were addressing the issues raised.  Additionally, plain clothes patrols were conducted.  This was less obtrusive and allowed us to observe and ascertain the existence of criminal activity and ASB.  Weapons sweeps were conducted in partnership with Lambeth council officials.

This was a hazard for pedestrians and it obstructed the view from a vantage point, thereby allowing criminals to conduct activities in secret.  Keith Badrick was made aware of the situation and Lambeth environmental department was tasked to attend to the foliage.  There is now a clear view of the footpath from the bridge above.  This is an excellent vantage point for officers and it deters shady activity from being conducted along the footpath.  Periodic plain cloths and unformed patrols are ongoing.  Graffiti is reported to Lambeth and a CRIMINT is created to log this event.  A follow up investigation would ensue from the intelligence gathered.

Kiver Rd. is a hotspot for violence and ASB linked to alcohol drug consumption and drug dealing activity. 

The aim is to reduce this type of activity on Kiver Rd, by conducting overt and covert patrols, increasing our stop and searches in the area and issuing ASB/ CPW/ CPN as well as working with local charities to seek help to the vulnerable people that are involved in the alcohol/ drug use in the area.

Concerns were raised about safety of women and girls within the West End. This is specific to issues of drink spiking and sexual assault in the night time economy. Crime reports have identify Night Time entertainment venues . Police will increase engagement and awareness events to engage and educate venue staff members/security  to ensure they are aware how to appropriately react if a crime has been committed. Also how to advise customers of issues / safety. This issue won’t be resolved completely but regular engagement with females who work and live on the ward can help broaden our understanding of where the problem areas are through Walk and Talk events and other engagement strategies.  We will provide awareness training liaising with open venues about ask for Angela and noticing signs of vulnerability.</issue><issue-date>2023-08-07</issue-date><action>ACTIONS: 
Increase high visibility patrols in the evening and night. Advertise walk and talks to engage with female members of the public who frequent in the ward or live there. Actively engage with the clubs in the ward to ensure they are up to date with training on how to protect women and girls. We will ensure hi-visibility patrols continue outside venues and around hotspot locations identified by regular analysis of Crime data. </action><action-date>2023-08-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle and theft of pedal cycle - St James Square and LSE</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-08-07</suggestion-date><issue>Theft from Motor Vehicle in the above location.
There has been an increase in theft from motor vehicle and vehicle related ASB within the St James Ward. In the build up to Christmas there will be a correlating increase in theft from motor vehicles in multi-storey carparks and locations such as Green Street in Mayfair. In response there will be an increase in High-visibility patrols in areas identified as hotspot locations, this will be coupled with a leafletting and poster campaign. Car park venues will be visited and crime prevention measures will be discussed with the operators and staff on site. Ward social media will be used to increase coverage of these campaigns. Groups entering into the ward footprint for ASB related activity will be targeted via the MO8 task force, established acoustic camera coverage and increasing the use of evidence gathered by MOP in taking enforcement action against the vehicles and drivers. 

</issue><issue-date>2023-08-07</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increase patrols in the identified hotspot locations, encourage use of police bicycles to deter thefts by individuals on bicycles, cover a wider area and increase frequency of officers in the area.

Residents in Mayfair and St James have told local officers that they have seen an increase in beggars along Piccadilly and Berkeley Street. They have stated that they are constantly asking for money and sometimes when refused they can get aggressive to members of the public. In response to these problems local officers will complete days of action, whereby a day will be spent making those beggars aware that it is against the law to beg. For those who are genuinely sleeping rough and require help, we will work with multiple welfare agencies and refer them to the most appropriate one if they require help or support. If they are found begging following this work, they will be issued with a community written warnings and notices to enforce against the problem. Partnership working with the Westminster Council will also take place to issue tickets to those that are engaging in illegal street trading. The aim will be to work with the street engagement team and immigration for persistent beggars reducing the issues for the community.</issue><issue-date>2023-08-07</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increased and targeted patrols around the most affected streets, complete patrols at peak times of begging. Partners have been engaged for welfare services to those that do not want to be sleeping rough. 
Have so far completed the first phase of this action by warning those about begging. The next action is starting issuing warnings</action><action-date>2023-08-07</action-date></priority></priorities>

The main area affected by violence is the area around Mcdonalds and on Neasden Lane north. The driver for this is ASB drug dealing/use in this area and Somalian cafe's along Neasden lane North. The Mcdolads also has the highest footfall of anywhere on the ward and where there are more people there will be more violent incidents. 
This will be measurable by a decrease in ASB calls to the area and an increase in positive stop and search in the area. 
The priority is to reduce violent crime on Neasden Lane North and the roads off it down to Breamar AVenue NW10. This is shown as our violent crime hotspot and will be measured by a reduction in violent crime by patrols in the area at the times violence has happened.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-25</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-04-25</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB and Street Drinking</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-25</suggestion-date><issue>The main area affected by violence is the area around Breamar Avenue NW10, Kelly Close, Neasden lane north and down breamar to Harp Island Close.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-17</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has been identified as a repeat area for robbery occurring in the West End. Soho is a small area relative to other wards in the area, it has a bustling night time economy which many thousands of people come to, primarily over the weekends. Robbery in Soho is mainly fuelled by the night time economy. Intoxicated patrons leaving bars, clubs, and pubs become targets for groups and individuals intent on stealing their personal property. It is a concern of Soho residents and visitors alike, as robbery is a highly invasive and distressing crime to become victim of. The Met has tasked pan-London units to patrol in Soho to combat these violent offences. The West End Proactive Partnership Team is the West End’s dedicated team of officers that are out on foot patrol covering the night time economy. They continue to actively target robbery suspects.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>Proactive teams from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group have already been conducting targeted patrols around Soho. This has seen numerous arrests for robbery and related offences, and disrupting those suspected of being involved in violent offences. Officers in Soho will continue to proactively identify offenders and stop robberies from occurring. Using evidence based approaches, targeting specific roads where the majority of offences are known to occur. High visibility patrols will continue to provide reassurance to members of the public, and provide both reactive and proactive elements in combating robbery, so officers are able to quickly attend calls in Soho. Local Ward officers will be hosting crime prevention stalls, and engagement events in busy areas of Soho which anyone is welcome to attend.</action><action-date>2023-04-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-04-17</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has seen sporadic but concentrated issues surrounding the blatant use of drugs on the streets. Several areas in Soho have repeatedly had issues with drug users congregating in areas with low foot traffic, doorways and poorly lit areas. Officers are aware and engaging with drug users, who the majority of are vulnerable or living on the streets. Officers have worked alongside the council and outreach services in order to take a longer term non-enforcement action, which in the long run will produce better more time efficient results as opposed to constantly arresting offenders. Some users/offenders are not engaging well with the diversion and assistance routes offered to them so enforcement action will be taken.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>Officers will continue to carry out proactive targeted patrols to problem areas at the times of day identified by residents. Officers to better utilise their stop and search powers coupled with solid information and intelligence submitted by residents and victims of Anti-Social Behaviour. Officers will also continue to make referrals to outreach services to those willing to engage. Officers will be issuing CPWs, CPN,s and eventually CBOs to prolific offenders that cause anti-social behaviour through the use of drugs. For residents, please submit information reports through official Met reporting channels as this information will get filtered to us, and we will use this information to proactively target anti-social behaviour hotspots.

They were concerned that PEDICABS are all coming together and parking their Pedi cabs mainly outside Hippodrome Casino. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted patrols over the next three months specifically looking at this issue. Problem Solving will take place working with Westminster Council and Wept team to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available.</issue><issue-date>2023-04-17</issue-date><action>Targeted patrols took place at different times, resulting in a number of CPN’s and community resolution for Pedi cabs. In addition, Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any issues with Pedi cabs, no matter how small it may seem. There have been a decrease of Pedi cabs in the area due to the approach officers and Westminster council have taken.</action><action-date>2023-04-17</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-16</suggestion-date><issue>Specific – This is a new priority set at this month’s ward panel based on the new guidance which states the first priority will be violence related or driven by violence and will be set by the local SNT.  After discussion with the panel regarding the previous priority of Domestic related Violence being difficult for the SNT to target it was agreed that the most relevant violence related offence on the ward is ASB related violence which would include violence between local drug users and street drinkers.  

Measurable – Police reports like PlanWeb and SNT Analytics measure violent offences which include all violence related offences across the ward.  They accurately show where and when the offences happened on the ward and predictive maps can produce hotspot patrol areas.

Attainable – We will utilise social media and continued hotspot patrols to alert residents how best to report violence related offences and Anti-social behaviour. We will work in conjunction with the council and the newly appointed LET team in order to target ASB and as such hopefully reducing ASB related violence and offer long term support and assistance to victims.  

Relevant – Measurable statistics and intelligence suggest this is the most relevant violence related offence on the ward. 

Time-Bound – This will be measured and reviewed at the next ward panel meeting (every three months).  This is particularly relevant for this priority as it is new and needs extra scrutiny.</issue><issue-date>2023-07-16</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-07-16</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drug related ASB</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-16</suggestion-date><issue>Specific – To reduce drug offences and drug related ASB.  This includes obvious drug related crime like supply and possession but also ASB such as users loitering in drug hotspots waiting to buy drugs.  This is always brought up at our ward panels as one of the top concerns of our residents.
 
Measurable – Drug offences like possession and supply can be measured by looking through crime reports and stop and search records for the ward.  ASB can be measured by airspace and CAD or any crime reports that emanate from an ASB CAD.  We can also listen to anecdotal reports at our ward panel meetings as the residents are quite aware of drug hotspots.  

Attainable – This will be attained by a mixture of high visibility and plain clothes patrols in and around drug hotspots on the ward.  We will apply for warrants where drug intelligence is relevant and closure orders on ASB producing premises if applicable.  

Relevant – The ward panel members have considered this a priority for some time and always want police to treat it as such.  Measurable statistics and intelligence support this.

Time Bound – This will be measured and reviewed at the next ward panel meeting (every three months)</issue><issue-date>2023-07-16</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-07-16</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Residential Burglary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-07-16</suggestion-date><issue>Specific – To reduce residential burglary on the ward.  This has always been a ward panel priority and a main concern of residents due to the impact on the victim and surrounding residents.  

Measurable – Police reports like PlanWeb and SNT Analytics measure both Commercial and residential burglary.  They accurately show where and when the offences happened on the ward and predictive maps can produce hotspot patrol areas.

Attainable – This will be attained by a mixture of high visibility and plain clothes patrols in and around drug hotspots on the ward.  We will utilise social media and cocooning to alert residents of potential hotspots and target local burglary nominal on the ward.

In line with MET policy. Reducing Robberies along Chamberlayne road.
To work in partnership with local community members and schools as a high proportion of robbery victims are of school age.
It had been reported that robberies were occurrring along Chamberlayne Road mostly between the hours of 1500 -1700 hrs Monday to Friday and that the victims are of school age.
School children like to have the lastest mobile phones or trainers for example which therefore makes them an easy target.  Also things such as not being aware to keep personal items out of sight when walking from school (airpods, watches, jewellery)
Potential partners would be the street watch scheme as well as 'safer space/haven' initative.
It's a busy main road with a local bus hub and the main exit route from Queens Park community school.
An increase in uniformed patrols and volunteers from the local community to provide a visible presence and deterrent.</issue><issue-date>2023-06-11</issue-date><action>Op Nightingale POP currently in place</action><action-date>2023-06-11</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Motor Vehicle Crime</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-06-11</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce the number of MV Crime  on the Ward and increase Crime Prevention advice  To reduce MV Crime and increase Crime Prevention awareness via Twitter , OWL and Contact points
