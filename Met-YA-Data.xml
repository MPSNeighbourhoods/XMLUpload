</action><action-date>2024-04-22</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB and Vagrancy</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-04-22</suggestion-date><issue>Brief description - Gants Hill Underground station serves as the main transport hub in Barkingside, that serves hundreds members of Public due to its direct link into Central London. Gants Hill Underground is also situated at a busy roundabout junction, that correspondingly attracts vagrancy, begging and general ASB at the traffic lights and subway underpasses.
</issue><issue-date>2024-04-22</issue-date><action>Actions

SPECIFIC: To reduce the number of rough sleepers that beg at public places at Gants Hill and the subway underpasses. General ASB creates a detrimental impact to the quality of life on the ward especially to the local community and residents, regarding feelings of their safety in the area especially during the night. 

MEASURABLE:  This can be measured on reporting incidents to Police and feedback during the community events, drop in surgery, community contact session at Gants hill Library.

ACHIEVABLE: The persistent usage of Dispersal orders under section 35-39 of Anti-Social Behaviour and Crime and Policing Act 2014. Utilising powers and legislation enables Officers to disperse Prolific Offenders for 48 hours especially as the area has a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO). Further action and contingencies include the usage of issuing ASB- anti-social behaviour warnings, Community Protection Warnings, and Community Protection Notices.

Measurable – Can be measured by Ward Panel and resident feedback, and by the number of these incidents reported to police.
Achievable – High visibility patrols in the affected area, vehicle stop-checks, joint operations with traffic police teams.  Preventative Acoustic Cameras.
Relevant – This vehicle ASB is negatively impacting on ward residents’ peace and well-being.

This attracts high footfall of local and visitors to the area and is a prime target for drug dealers to operate. ASB associated with this could also be a potential for violence on the ward. Residents want police to target this area to reduce crime and build confidence.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-30</suggestion-date><issue>DRUGS
The main areas of concern for reducing drug dealing and taking of miss-used substances are THE SIGERS, AZALEA WALK, PEMBROKE PARK ESTATE and all alleyways in and around the areas 

Eastcote officers conduct regular Hi Viz patrols at the location and surrounding areas to prevent these activities from happening and arrest offenders if offences are present. Officers do plain clothes patrols and work in conjunction with the local residents to combat these crimes. 

Long term plan is to reduce the drugs problem in the local area by continuing to work with local resident and other agencies to combat drugs offences. 

This is one of Eastcote's ward priority's set by the local residents from the live survey submitted online

This priority is reviewed at each quarterly ward panel meeting</issue><issue-date>2023-11-30</issue-date><action>We have been actively patrolling these areas to deter drug dealing in these areas. We have also held street briefings in these areas to speak to residents.</action><action-date>2023-11-30</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Anti Social Behaviour</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-30</suggestion-date><issue>Eastcote Ward during the Autumn months sees a large uplift in the youths congregating in the open spaces/parks especially Warrender Park and Field end road causing anti-social behaviour such as letting off fireworks and dressing up in Halloween costumes to put others in fear.  
Begging on Field end road has also been highlighted as a concern.

Local neighbourhood officers conduct regular Hi-Viz patrols in and around these areas and work alongside several other departments such as neighbourhood tasking teams to try and ensure lots of high visibility patrols are completed and individuals are dealt with accordingly to tackle the ongoing issue
Officers look at dates and times when these offences are being committed to have high visibility patrols at the affected areas present to deter anyone committing any offences and deal with any other offences at the time. 

This a ward priority set by local residents which gets reviewed at every quarterly meeting and may change depending on the review of offences reported against other crimes 

Regular review is carried out by officers and feedback given to local residents of what officers have done via messages on social media platforms.</issue><issue-date>2023-11-30</issue-date><action>We have conducted high visible patrols in these areas to tackle the issue.</action><action-date>2023-11-30</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Violence Against Women and Girls</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-30</suggestion-date><issue>Concerns have been raised at the recent ward panel around areas on the ward where women have felt unsafe walking.

Tackle drugs activity and robberies in and around the area of Feltham Parks and look to reduce and prevent it where possible.
The team were able to identify a group of three robbers who were subsequently arrested and charged. We then stopped and detained a different group of three other robbers who were also arrested. 
There were a large number of gang nominal who had recently been travelling to Feltham Parks and loitering there in groups. They have been selling both class A drugs as well as cannabis and are armed with large hunting knives. We have focused our efforts on identifying as many nominal involved in this activity as possible to help us build accurate and useful intelligence and have arrested subjects when it has been safe to do so.
Most recently one of the males arrested is now currently in prison after an arrest by the team, another was arrested when found with class A drugs and a third was arrested for weapons offensives. 
The team is also utilising CBOs, CPNS and ASB warning notices to disrupt these gang nominal by restricting which locations they can visit and who they can associate with, which so far is proving to be effective.</issue><issue-date>2023-10-23</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2023-10-23</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Antisocial behaviour in North Feltham</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-10-23</suggestion-date><issue>The team will focus their efforts in reducing antisocial behaviour on the ward by identifying groups and individuals involved in causing this.

To reduce incidents of Robbery and burglary in the Earl’s Court area.
Measurable: the incidences of robbery and burglary can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, and ASB reports relating to robbery and attempted robbery.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by the continuation of high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, vehicle patrols, variation of shifts to include late and night shifts, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening. We also provide crime prevention advice and engagement via social media. Earl’s Court SNT officers regularly change their shifts to combat robbery and burglary, and conduct stop and search where grounds exist.  Robbery and burglary patrols are conducted on the Earls Court Road and surrounding streets. The Earls Court ward panel members are often given crime prevention advice regarding knife point robberies.

Measurable: this can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, intelligence reports, and ASB reports relating to drugs, as well as the anecdotal evidence seen by officers, WP members and local residents.

Earl’s Court officers have been proactive in obtaining two very successful warrants recently, recovering approx. £30,000 of drugs. Drug users have reported that the area is currently ‘too hot’ for drugs and they are going elsewhere. Local drug users are regularly stopped and searched, leading to a number of arrests and community resolutions. The drug hotspots in Earls Court are around Nevern Square, Nevern Place, Trebovir Road and Templeton Place. These areas are patrolled when officers are on duty.

This priority is aimed at reducing the street robberies in and around the Winstanley Estate area. In particular, any streets or public greens such as York Gardens which serve as a thoroughfare for commuters egressing from Clapham Junction who may find themselves as victims of personal robbery, in particular during the hours of darkness later in the year.
Ongoing patrols where our late turn shifts allow serve as a good point to deal with this.

This is not bespoke to one particular area of our ward, instead it is found to exist in multiple areas across Latchmere.
Will will map out each crime using Met Insights / PlanWeb, and using this data, we will be able to work out hotspots and as such, co-ordinate patrols effectively.
When at each hotspot, and circumstance permitting, good use of Stop and Search, and where applicable, good use of the information sharing agreement with the council may assist in dealing with those most troublesome.
ASB comes in many form - such as, noise disturbances from addresses engaged in drug dealing, loitering in and around these areas thus putting neighbours in fear of harm, urination / defecation in stairwells and other public access areas of buildings, graffiti. The list is non exhaustive.
Where we identify addresses that are causing ASB issues and where drugs are the nucleus, we can use ASB powers to good use - such as Closure Orders under Section 80 of the ASB Act of 2014.</issue><issue-date>2024-01-09</issue-date><action>High Visibility patrols to the locations identified to deter those committing Anti-Social Behaviour.

Subsequently, these mopeds are used to commit crimes. We aim to disrupt this activity by carrying out targeted patrols. Using any intelligence gained from open or closed sources, and utilising local knowledge, we will work to address this problem.
Though it is not a large problem on our ward, the theft of catalytic converters is nevertheless an issue. When the analytics are viewed on PlanWeb, we normally see a spike in the winter months. It is hoped that campaigns such as Autumn Nights and Winter Nights will serve as a deterrent for any would-be opportunists.
In order to deal with the theft-from element, we will utilise social media by putting out reminders to owners of vehicles to lock it and secure it.

This area has seen increased robberies in recent months. We will work in partnership with the college to reduce these offences which have predominantly impacted young people and will restore the public’s confidence in being able to use these shared spaces safely. 
In order to achieve this we will conduct patrols in partnership with the local authority as well as working in collaboration with the college to provide crime prevention sessions with the students. We will use a data driven approach to inform our patrols and tactics to combat this type of crime.
We will hold ourselves accountable using the MPS published crime figures for this area.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-01-24</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERIES
S. To reduce the amount of robberies on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of robberies happen near to Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road. This is due to residents/non-residents attending the area and visiting local bars and restaurant’s. Members of public are then normally targeted walking home from venues in off streets from the main roads.

A. Though Plain Cloths operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. A mobile CCTV camera has been requested from the council and placed on the junction of Old Brompton Road and Drayton Gardens to tackle the issue. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Creswell Place and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. Robberies appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. 

T. To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting.

Statistic’s are showing a slight rise in high value residential Burglaries, which are being targeted. Entrance through windows is common place by force using blunt tools....and using scaffolding to access neighbours..
 ***Garage burglaries have shown an increase***
SMART:-
Specific  –  Prevent and Reduce burglaries on the whole ward.
Measurable – Measure through, statistic crime reports, trend mapping and calls to police (Crimes recorded).
Achievable – Attained through preventative high visibility patrols in key areas / Cocooning /Social media posts /Crime prevention.
Relevant – Due to the personal nature of the crime this is a top ward priority. Summer conditions, increases burglary activity.

This will be measured through a record of work undertaken, enforcement action and a review of the benchmark safety question isolating data from female respondents 

This is achievable through the following actions: 

Safe space drop in sites for victims of domestic violence to report/seek advice 

Crime prevention and advice stalls focusing on violence against women/girls 

We will make attempts to arrest outstanding domestic violence offenders on the ward 

We will enforce domestic violence protection orders/notices within the ward 

We will provide safer spaces for women/girls to exercise 

We conduct patrols and operations to target areas where incidents of violence against women/girls occur 

This is relevant as violence against women and girls is a significant issue, with many female respondents in the most recent ward survey expressing concerns and fears regarding certain areas in action and behaviour of men in the area. 

This will run for the next 3 months and will be reviewed at the next ward panel. </issue><issue-date>2024-05-07</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-05-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Panel Priority – Royal Park Leisure</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-05-07</suggestion-date><issue>We will work to make Park Royal leisure a safer environment for legitimate users 

This will be achieved through targeted patrols to provide reassurance, working in partnership with businesses, on site security and land owners. Covert policing tactics will also be used to identify those engaging in crime. 

This will be measured through a record of work, enforcement actions. 

This is relevant as the venue is described as feeling unsafe, it also suffers from consistent anti-social behaviour as well as incidents of violence 

This will run for the next 3 months and will be reviewed at the next ward panel. </issue><issue-date>2024-05-07</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-05-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Panel Priority – Canal and Wesley Gardens</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-05-07</suggestion-date><issue>We will work to make the canal feel like safer environment, and in the process with build strong relationship with the Wesley Gardens residents

This is relevant as the canal areas has suffered consistently from anti-social behaviour and drugs use. Survey completion in the area was very low, indicating a lack of engagement with police.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-02-26</suggestion-date><issue>The local team will priorities robberies following 8 offences being recorded over the previous quarter. 
All allegations of robbery within the ward will be attended, local enquiries with possible witnesses and CCTV will be pursued to assist in the investigation
Where possible, contact will be maintained with victims to ensure they are supported through the process
Any suspects will be targeted through ‘Achilles Heel’ tactics for other offences in order to deter these offenders.
Patrols will be completed in areas identified at high risk where possible to deter offenders
Stop and search will be used where intelligence supports action to detect people carrying weapons and stolen property
The team will engage with the Priority Crime Unit to support their investigations where possible
The success of the work will be based on the number of offences recorded between 27/02/2024 and 22/05/2024
These actions are achievable with prioritisation, however some will require the assistance of other teams and units
This is relevant due to the increased number of offences and the nature of the offence
The priority will be reviewed on 22/05/2024 with the ward panel</issue><issue-date>2024-02-26</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-02-26</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Substance Abuse</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-02-26</suggestion-date><issue>The SNT will target offenders abusing substances in the ward, utilising Achilles heels tactics to disrupt and deter offending, including use of the Public Space Protection Order.
Where intelligence is received about supply or use, the team will actively use all powers available to disrupt these offenders and obtain evidence of these offences.
Officers will continue to engage with the community to identify areas where these issues are prevalent, including engaging with local businesses and enforcing licence conditions for the sale of alcohol.

The SNT will record encounters and present these results to the ward panel 

Officers will be present in the community and come across issues for substance abuse, paying specific attention to these problems will make this goal achievable.

This has been sighted as an issue on the survey and by the ward panel and therefore it is relevant

This priority has been set for 3 months and will be reviewed at the next Ward panel meeting on 22/05/2024

All reported crimes and Anti-Social Behaviour will be reviewed and where we can add value we will offer assistance.
The team will liaise with partners and charities with a view to improve infrastructure in the immediate area
The team will work with the British Transport Police to understand combined issues and assist in joint working
The team will continue to address Violence Against Women and Girls in this immediate area
Community Protection Notices and Warnings will be used to prohibit behaviour
Enhanced patrols will be completed in the area, both overt and covert.
This will be measured by both the perception of crime and positive interventions from the team
Presence cannot be maintained persistently but enhanced presence is achievable
This location is the main drive for multiple issues and therefore is relevant

Safe space drop in sites for victims of domestic violence to report/seek advice 

Crime prevention and advice stalls focusing on violence against women/girls 

We will make attempts to arrest outstanding domestic violence offenders on the ward 

We will enforce domestic violence protection orders/notices within the ward 

We will provide safer spaces for women/girls to exercise 

We conduct patrols and operations to target areas where incidents of violence against women/girls occur 

This is relevant as violence against women and girls is a significant issue, with many female respondents in the most recent ward survey expressing concerns and fears regarding certain areas in action and behaviour of men in the area. 

This will run for the next 3 months and will be reviewed at the next ward panel. </issue><issue-date>2024-05-07</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-05-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Panel Priority - Parcel Theft</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-05-07</suggestion-date><issue>We will work to reduce the number of parcels thefts within the ward 

This will be measured through a record of work undertaken, enforcement action taken and a review of crime statistics. 

This will be achieved through target hardening measures, crime prevention advice and targeted patrols both overt/covert 

This is relevant at parcel theft is consistent raised as an issue by respondents in the ward survey, and crime statistic support that this is a crime type that continues to occur within the ward. 

This will run for the next 3 months and will be reviewed at the next ward panel. </issue><issue-date>2024-05-07</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-05-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Rowdy/Inconsiderate behaviour and drug use by groups</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-05-07</suggestion-date><issue>We will target groups who gather and engage in rowdy/inconsiderate behaviour or drugs use 
  
This will be measured through a record or work, including enforcement action. 

This will be achieved through targeted patrols and proactive use of PSPO powers, the use of CPW/CPN and ethical stop and search. 

This is relevant as the issue of drug use, and associated ASB was the most significant issue according to residents who completed the ward survey, public order and rowdy behaviour by groups was also of significant concern 

This will run for the next 3 months and will be reviewed at the next ward panel. </issue><issue-date>2024-05-07</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-05-07</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-03-15</suggestion-date><issue>1 Robbery
The local team will prioritise robberies following a few offences being recorded over the previous quarter. 
All allegations of robbery within the ward will be attended, local enquiries with possible witnesses and CCTV will be pursued to assist in the investigation
Where possible, contact will be maintained with victims to ensure they are supported through the process
Any suspects will be targeted through ‘Achilles Heel’ tactics for other offences in order to deter these offenders.
Patrols will be completed in areas identified at high risk where possible to deter offenders
Stop and search will be used where intelligence supports action to detect people carrying weapons and stolen property
The team will engage with the Priority Crime Unit to support their investigations where possible
The success of the work will be based on the number of offences recorded between 6/03/2024 and 5/6/2024
These actions are achievable with prioritisation, however some will require the assistance of other teams and units
This is relevant due to the increased number of offences and the nature of the offence
The priority will be reviewed on 5th June 2024 at the next ward panel meeting
</issue><issue-date>2024-03-15</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-03-15</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drug Dealing</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-03-15</suggestion-date><issue>The local team will focus on drug use and supply, specifically targeting to disrupt users and supply of drugs. This will be achieved through concentration of Hot spot areas identified to us around Rayners Lane Estate, Newton Farm Ecology Park and the surrounding streets. Drugs users found in possession of drugs paraphernalia but not substance will be issued with Community Protection Notice Warnings (CPNW’s) in order to prohibit anti-social behaviour. Any breaches will be dealt with robustly.
Premises with closure orders will be monitored to ensure that they no longer attract drug users and keep the users visible on the streets to allow them to be dealt with by CPNW.
A Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) will be considered in any conviction following breaches of CPN’s to give long term solutions
Drug users are believed to be influencing a spike in theft from motor vehicle offences and motor vehicle interference offences, this also fuels violent crime through the supply of drugs and disputes over territory around supply areas.
This will be measured as quantifiable results for searches of persons, premises and vehicles for drugs, CPNW’s issued and breaches of closures orders.
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

This covers a wide range of issues including tipping, littering, spitting, breaches of the public space protection order and noise issues.
The local ward team will triage allegations of ASB in the community which are reported to police. The team will work with Kingdom Security and ensure coverage of the ward when the ward team are not on duty is maximised using these other resources to address these concerns. Persons identified as causing ASB will be engaged with and where the evidence supports, issued with prohibitions under community protection legislation to address these behaviours. The police will continue to refer incidents of tipping to the local authority and assist where necessary in progressing their investigations into these offences.
This will be measured by collating the number of ASB allegations which are made to police and the relevant interventions that are introduced by police.
The ward team are actively involved in reducing ASB as part of our core duties and therefore with some intensification, this should be achievable
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-03-15</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY – Violence Related Priority

Ward Priority 1 - Violence 
This is the MPS priority set in the ward panel from 20/01/2024.
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on a greater awareness of Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG).
The police will specifically conduct proactive engagement with the relevant demographics and other demographics who wish to highlight issues. A minimum of two events will be held within the ward and one of these will operate in the vicinity of Rayners Lane Tube Station.
The team will gather relevant information about where people feel unsafe and also address the perception of crime. A comprehensive intelligence and information picture will be developed over the period which will be presented to the ward panel and will be analysed to establish if there are available interventions
This process is intended to better understand the problem, previous interactions of this nature have been well received and well attended and therefore this should be achievable
This links to violence and the fear of violence, it is therefore relevant
This engagement will commence for three months and should be sufficient time to develop an understanding of local issues
</issue><issue-date>2024-03-15</issue-date><action>Rayners Lane SNT PC's and PCSO have conducted regular mobile and foot patrols across the ward during various times of the day. We have completed daily weapons sweeps at various locations especially at hot spots, such as service roads on ALEXANDRA AVENUE and concealed staircases.
 
Operation GOODRICH: Local ward officers have been patrolling RAYNERS LANE STATION to engage with girls and women to make them aware about the VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) and issue literature, give advice and encourage women and girls to report any unsafe streets on STREET SAFE.
</action><action-date>2024-03-15</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 2 - Substance Abuse</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-03-15</suggestion-date><issue>The SNT will target offenders abusing substances in the ward, utilising Achilles heels tactics to disrupt and deter offending, including use of the Public Space Protection Order.
Where intelligence is received about supply or use, the team will actively use all powers available to disrupt these offenders and obtain evidence of these offences.
Officers will continue to engage with the community to identify areas where these issues are prevalent, including engaging with local businesses and enforcing licence conditions for the sale of alcohol.

The SNT will record encounters and present these results to the ward panel 

Officers will be present in the community and come across issues for substance abuse, paying specific attention to these problems will make this goal achievable.

This has been sighted as an issue on the survey and by the ward panel and therefore it is relevant

This priority has been set for 3 months and will be reviewed at the next Ward panel meeting on 04/05/2024
</issue><issue-date>2024-03-15</issue-date><action>Patrols in area known for the most drug use, such as, Alexander Avenue and Rayner Lane and Community Protection Warnings and Community Protection Notices will be issued to nominals known to police for drug. 
Research and intelligence gathering underway for consideration of targeted individuals and addresses for enforcement action.  High visibility Patrols taken place in locations where the majority of incidents take place.  Local contact with residents and local shop keepers to alleviate their concerns. 

Street briefings across roads where issues have occurred to notify public of police action and for intelligence gathering.  
</action><action-date>2024-03-15</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 3 - Burglary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-03-15</suggestion-date><issue>This priority is set by the ward panel from 20/01/2024 until 04/05/2024
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on the prevention and detection of burglaries.
The police will specifically identify all allegations of burglary within the ward, including both residential and non-residential burglaries. The team will complete local enquiries and complete CCTV trawls in order to identify suspect leads and contribute towards investigations of these offences.
The team will identify the most prolific offenders and use Achilles heels tactics with these individuals to remove their opportunity to commit these offences.
The team will proactively engage and support the priority crime unit to assist with their investigations and help to develop linked series of offences where there are opportunities to do so.
The team will actively promote crime prevention advice for specified roads within the ward that are a greater risk of Asian Gold thefts which are known to increase at this time of year.
The proactive operation will be led by the team targeting offenders, crime prevention is a within the capacity of the team to deliver and therefore this is achievable
The panel have elected this priority, this has been corroborated by the ward panel survey and it is relevant to the local area.
</issue><issue-date>2024-03-15</issue-date><action>The team have attended and completed follow up visits to all victims of burglary who reside within the ward. The officers have been completing CCTV trawls and gathering intelligence to determine offending patters and similar methods to maximise the quality of investigations.

Officers have been using powers to search suspects for stolen property, and for articles going equipped to steal within the ward.

S: To reduce knife-enabled watch robberies around Fulham Road, King’s Road and Chelsea Green.

A: This can be achieved by the continuation of Op Vigrid targeted robbery patrols, high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening - crime prevention advice via social media and face-to-face community engagement events.
R: This issue has been prevalent across AW BCU, and recent months have seen offences spreading from Westminster into RBKandC. A number of these offences have received viral coverage on social media. The number of offences has reduced since the end of summer, and has reduced further over the past 3 months, however this remains a priority crime for the area, especially as the weather grows warmer, when historically these offences begin to increase.

M: Measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.
A: This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through effective use of cocooning visits, crime prevention advice via social media and face-to-face community engagement events.
R: This number of these type of offences has dropped slightly over the Christmas period since the last Ward Panel meeting, however there was a rise in offences in February. Historically this type of crime tends to increase in the months leading up to Christmas, and also as the weather becomes warmer and windows are left open.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-02-27</suggestion-date><issue>Serious youth violence continues to be a priority for the ward officers. Although there have been very few incidents of this recently there were many in the past and we do not want to return to this! Whilst the incidents have been rare in the past few years it does occasionally raise its head but the ward officer’s determination, dedication and knowledge has had a great effect on keeping a lid on this and improving the quality of life for the residents. The SNT officers sometimes use local resources to work in partnership with, in order to address any incidents or concerns as well as local partners including Westminster housing, local charities, schools and local leaders to prevent any further incidents.</issue><issue-date>2024-02-27</issue-date><action>Officers patrol regularly on the Churchill Gardens estate, providing a high visibility presence and reassurance for the residents- someone they can speak to about any concerns. The team also work closely with the youth club on the estate and engage with the young residents. They conduct regular weapon sweeps to reduce storage of weapons and the location is dependent on the recent intelligence received. 
The use of community protection notices and other disposal options continues to be a great way of keeping a check on this.</action><action-date>2024-02-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Groups of Youths</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-02-27</suggestion-date><issue>Residents in the Churchill Gardens estate have told Local Officers that they have seen an increase in anti-social behaviour on the estate committed predominantly by youths who reside on the ward or the surrounding wards. This anti-social behaviour recently has been committed in the communal areas predominantly in Meadow Garden and Chippendale House. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted high visibility patrols on the estate in the relevant blocks to firstly act as a deterrent but also to be there to witness and speak to those who are engaging in this anti-social behaviour and other activities such as spitting and cannabis smoking. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. The local ward officers have worked hard to improve this issue and although there are incidents they are decreasing in frequency, this is helped due to the officer’s personal approach as they know most of the youths and the use of CPN's etc.</issue><issue-date>2024-02-27</issue-date><action>The actions the officers will take to address this priority is to continue their high visibility patrols in the communal areas and those that are impacted by this anti-social behaviour. They will continue to issue community protection notices and warnings where appropriate and engage with both the youths and their families to dissuade them from repeating certain behaviours. The Meadow garden and Chippendale house will be targeted for the next few months and will then be re-assessed.</action><action-date>2024-02-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB caused by the street population</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-02-27</suggestion-date><issue>Residents in St George’s Square and the surrounding residential streets have informed Local Officers that they have seen an increase in problems relating to drug taking and misuse in the square. They were concerned that drug dealing groups are coming into the area from other parts of South London and selling to the vulnerable individuals that live in the local hostels and to the street population who are drawn into the area by the appeal of Victoria station. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted patrols over the next three months specifically looking at this issue. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. Officers will be receiving support from other internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London. This work will also be supported by the area based Violence Suppression teams who can add extra numbers and skills to impact of resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2024-02-27</issue-date><action>Local officers will address this issue by conducting regular patrols in the hotspot areas on the ward to act as a deterrent to the behaviour and also to address an anti-social behaviour or drug activity that they witness by means of community protection warnings or notices that target behaviours such as begging, littering and general ASB in the area. They will engage with other MET resources to provide more support and attention to the area and to engage and deal with individuals they find engaging in drugs or drug- related activity in the area. Local officers are also working with partner agencies to support the vulnerable individuals impacted by drug use and the related anti-social behaviour but they are also increasing their focus on disrupting drug supplies and dealings in the area by means of applying for warrants to seize drugs, to conduct stop and searches where grounds exist and take appropriate action such as arrest, the seizure of drugs and other disposal options will be considered. Officers engage in both uniformed patrols and plain clothes operations to target hotspot areas. Local officers also engage with both the staff and the residents of the hostels that are in the vicinity of the ward and the local street population to address the anti-social behaviour that they engage with and the impact it has on residents.</action><action-date>2024-02-27</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-01-09</suggestion-date><issue>One of the ward’s priorities is related to violence, to look at where it occurs on the ward and how local officers can prevent and address it. Violent crimes on Pimlico North are rare but perceived violence is common which can be contributed to the fact that Victoria train station is on the ward and there is a large number of street population around. Local officers aim to decrease this perceived violence by increasing high visibility patrols when they are in and with the use of extra resources within the MET such as the territorial support group, the violence suppression unit, mounted branch and working with British Transport Police. This partnership work with other units will decrease and discourage actual and perceived violence on the ward and increase confidence by targeting areas with high footfall. This will be achievable by SNT officers being visibly seen and available to patrol the areas stated, to deter the crime and also addressing any anti-social behaviour. As a ward who has a high percentage of residents living across the ward the priority is relevant to make the residents and neighbourhoods feel safe.</issue><issue-date>2024-01-09</issue-date><action>
Officers will increase their high visibility patrols on the ward to deter crime and address anti-social behaviour that is deemed intimidating by residents. Officers will also have joint operations with the British transport police to address violent crimes that occur in and around Victoria Station, they will also hold crime prevention stalls in the station on a more frequent basis.</action><action-date>2024-01-09</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Concentrating on Street Population and the area around Victoria Train Station.</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-01-09</suggestion-date><issue>This is very similar to priority 1. ASB is low in the area and when it does occur, it is often attributed to the street population around the Lillington and Longmore estate and around Victoria train Station. Last quarter this had spread to adjacent areas but concentrated patrols appears to have reduced this. However reports of drug taking in private gardens and cellar areas still raises it head. Begging, drug taking, drug paraphernalia, rubbish being left are all symptoms of the street population and will be targeted by local officers. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. We will be receiving support from our Local Policing teams such as The Violence Suppression unit and Gangs Unit, who can add extra numbers and skills to have an impact on resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2024-01-09</issue-date><action>Heightened patrols will take place at targeted times and locations in order to target the issue. The use of community protection notices will continue, targeting those engaging in anti-social behaviour. We will work alongside our partners, including the VBID, Homeless charities and above all, Hopkinson House. Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any signs of potential drug dealing, no matter how small it may seem. If any community members would also like to be part of a walk-along patrol to discuss this issue, please use the contact forms on this site. Local officers  will continue to work with  both internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London and other police forces such as the City of London Police and British Transport Police to conduct joint operations focusing on areas known as drug hotspots and attempting to disrupt county lines. Drug Dealers will also continue to be our prime target.</action><action-date>2024-01-09</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft of mail</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-01-09</suggestion-date><issue>Pimlico North had 17 crimes reported in the last 3 months, where victims have been targeted for their phones. Unsuspecting victims have their phones in their hands and suspects, usually on bikes or electric scooters, come up to them and snatch their phones from them. They then make off at speed. With their faces covered up, CCTV is often of no use in identifying these offenders.</issue><issue-date>2024-01-09</issue-date><action>This requires a 2 pronged attack. Education of victims and detection of suspects. Police need to raise awareness that this crime is occurring in this area. This can be done by speaking to members of the public who are seen with their phones out. Leaflets can be distributed and left in key positions as well as posters displayed in stores and coffee shops. Officers will increase patrols in key areas and at key times in an attempt to detect offenders. Both uniformed and plain clothes patrols utilising bikes as well as utilising stop and search will help detect and prevent offences.</action><action-date>2024-01-09</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) - VILLIERS STREET, DOVER STREET and BERKELEY STREET
Concerns were raised about safety of women and girls within the West End. This is specific to issues of drink spiking and sexual assault in the night time economy. Crime reports have identify Night Time entertainment venues . Police will increase engagement and awareness events to engage and educate venue staff members/security  to ensure they are aware how to appropriately react if a crime has been committed. Also how to advise customers of issues / safety. This issue won’t be resolved completely but regular engagement with females who work and live on the ward can help broaden our understanding of where the problem areas are through Walk and Talk events and other engagement strategies.  We will provide awareness training liaising with open venues about ask for Angela and noticing signs of vulnerability.</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>ACTIONS: 
Increase high visibility patrols in the evening and night. Advertise walk and talks to engage with female members of the public who frequent in the ward or live there. Actively engage with the clubs in the ward to ensure they are up to date with training on how to protect women and girls. We will ensure hi-visibility patrols continue outside venues and around hotspot locations identified by regular analysis of Crime data. 
Have officers from our WEPT and TSG conduct static patrols surrounding our hot spot areas during the peak times for robbery.  Review the location of the offences where this is happening and consider Design Out options to prevent this crime from occurring in the first place.  Check that there is enough CCTV coverage of the hotspot areas so that evidence of the crimes can be captured and lead to successful prosecutions.</action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle and theft of pedal cycle - St James Square and LSE</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Theft from Motor Vehicle in the above location.
There has been an increase in theft from motor vehicle and vehicle related ASB within the St James Ward. In the build up to Christmas there will be a correlating increase in theft from motor vehicles in multi-storey carparks and locations such as Green Street in Mayfair. In response there will be an increase in High-visibility patrols in areas identified as hotspot locations, this will be coupled with a leafletting and poster campaign. Car park venues will be visited and crime prevention measures will be discussed with the operators and staff on site. Ward social media will be used to increase coverage of these campaigns. Groups entering into the ward footprint for ASB related activity will be targeted via the MO8 task force, established acoustic camera coverage and increasing the use of evidence gathered by MOP in taking enforcement action against the vehicles and drivers. 

</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increase patrols in the identified hotspot locations, encourage use of police bicycles to deter thefts by individuals on bicycles, cover a wider area and increase frequency of officers in the area. Increase the number of social media posts relating to vehicle related crime in the build up to Christmas. </action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Berkeley Square, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and Bow Street</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Begging, congregating in groups around the restaurants/cafes in Berkeley Sq
Residents in Mayfair and St James have told local officers that they have seen an increase in beggars along Piccadilly and Berkeley Street. They have stated that they are constantly asking for money and sometimes when refused they can get aggressive to members of the public. In response to these problems local officers will complete days of action, whereby a day will be spent making those beggars aware that it is against the law to beg. For those who are genuinely sleeping rough and require help, we will work with multiple welfare agencies and refer them to the most appropriate one if they require help or support. If they are found begging following this work, they will be issued with a community written warnings and notices to enforce against the problem. Partnership working with the Westminster Council will also take place to issue tickets to those that are engaging in illegal street trading. The aim will be to work with the street engagement team and immigration for persistent beggars reducing the issues for the community.</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increased and targeted patrols around the most affected streets, complete patrols at peak times of begging. Partners have been engaged for welfare services to those that do not want to be sleeping rough. 
Have so far completed the first phase of this action by warning those about begging. The next action is starting issuing warnings</action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority></priorities>

Valence SNT are aware there are a group of street drinkers who congregate outside William Hill and continue to pay attention and deal with any incidents accordingly. 

As there is not a PSPO in force police are unable to enforce penalties to those seen drinking on the street, however the team are working closely with staff at William Hill and other premises to reduce ASB in the area.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-12-29</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has been identified as a repeat area for robbery occurring in the West End. Soho is a small area relative to other wards in the area, it has a bustling night time economy which many thousands of people come to, primarily over the weekends. Robbery in Soho is mainly fuelled by the night time economy. Intoxicated patrons leaving bars, clubs, and pubs become targets for groups and individuals intent on stealing their personal property. It is a concern of Soho residents and visitors alike, as robbery is a highly invasive and distressing crime to become victim of. The Met has tasked pan-London units to patrol in Soho to combat these violent offences. The West End Proactive Partnership Team is the West End’s dedicated team of officers that are out on foot patrol covering the night time economy. They continue to actively target robbery suspects.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Proactive teams from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group have already been conducting targeted patrols around Soho. This has seen numerous arrests for robbery and related offences, and disrupting those suspected of being involved in violent offences. Officers in Soho will continue to proactively identify offenders and stop robberies from occurring. Using evidence based approaches, targeting specific roads where the majority of offences are known to occur. High visibility patrols will continue to provide reassurance to members of the public, and provide both reactive and proactive elements in combating robbery, so officers are able to quickly attend calls in Soho. Local Ward officers will be hosting crime prevention stalls, and engagement events in busy areas of Soho which anyone is welcome to attend.</action><action-date>2023-12-29</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-12-29</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has seen sporadic but concentrated issues surrounding the blatant use of drugs on the streets. Several areas in Soho have repeatedly had issues with drug users congregating in areas with low foot traffic, doorways and poorly lit areas. Officers are aware and engaging with drug users, who the majority of are vulnerable or living on the streets. Officers have worked alongside the council and outreach services in order to take a longer term non-enforcement action, which in the long run will produce better more time efficient results as opposed to constantly arresting offenders. Some users/offenders are not engaging well with the diversion and assistance routes offered to them so enforcement action will be taken.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Officers will continue to carry out proactive targeted patrols to problem areas at the times of day identified by residents. Officers to better utilise their stop and search powers coupled with solid information and intelligence submitted by residents and victims of Anti-Social Behaviour. Officers will also continue to make referrals to outreach services to those willing to engage. Officers will be issuing CPWs, CPN,s and eventually CBOs to prolific offenders that cause anti-social behaviour through the use of drugs. For residents, please submit information reports through official Met reporting channels as this information will get filtered to us, and we will use this information to proactively target anti-social behaviour hotspots.

They were concerned that PEDICABS are all coming together and parking their Pedi cabs mainly outside Hippodrome Casino. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted patrols over the next three months specifically looking at this issue. Problem Solving will take place working with Westminster Council and Wept team to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Targeted patrols took place at different times, resulting in a number of CPN’s and community resolution for Pedi cabs. In addition, Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any issues with Pedi cabs, no matter how small it may seem. There have been a decrease of Pedi cabs in the area due to the approach officers and Westminster council have taken.</action><action-date>2023-12-29</action-date></priority></priorities>

In line with MET policy. Reducing Robberies along Chamberlayne Road.
To work in partnership with local community members and schools as a high proportion of robbery victims are of school age.
It had been reported that robberies were occurring along Chamberlayne Road mostly between the hours of 1500 -1700 hrs Monday to Friday and that the victims are of school age.
School children like to have the latest mobile phones or trainers for example which therefore makes them an easy target.  Also things such as not being aware to keep personal items out of sight when walking from school (air pods, watches, jewellery)
Potential partners would be the street watch scheme as well as 'safer space/haven' imitative.
It's a busy main road with a local bus hub and the main exit route from Queens Park community school.
An increase in uniformed patrols and volunteers from the local community to provide a visible presence and deterrent.
S - Robbery offences

A - Team possesses good contacts with specialist units which assist in the development of intel, and the execution of warrants.

S - Interventions are limited to specific locations within Tokyngton Recreation Ground
M - Impact of interventions may be measured by public feedback; either from community leaders or from ward residents who commonly encounter police on foot patrol.
A - The location has already seen an incremental improvement in terms of ASB. Contacts within the council and other partners consolidate capacity of police to counter ASB.

R - Interventions have been carried out following feedback from community members while on foot-patrol. Residents have questioned their safety due to groups congregating on the low walls.

T - improving the park is a long term aspiration. At the end of March, the situation will be evaluated as ASB is linked to seasonal changes.</issue><issue-date>2024-02-02</issue-date><action>* A joint visit has been conducted with the DESIGNING OUT CRIME UNIT and the council in order to formulate recommendations for the park in the long term.

S - the primary goal of this priority is to consolidate the ward panel.
M - Having a ward panel with ten committed and regular members is the goal that the team is looking to achieve by the end of March.
A - Officers have a vast network of personal contacts in the ward. These personal contacts should easily be translated into ward panel members, especially with the high level of commitment demonstrated by current panel members.

R - since COVID, Tokyngton' s Ward Panel activity has remained dormant. Reclaiming local spaces affected by ASB will take community intervention as well as police intervention.

T - The next ward panel is to be organised by the end of March.</issue><issue-date>2024-02-02</issue-date><action>* A member of the ward panel had attended a meeting for Ward Panel Chairs, meaning that a reliable leadership figure for the Ward Panel may be secure.
