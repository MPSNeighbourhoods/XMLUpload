</issue><issue-date>2025-07-07</issue-date><action>1.	To prioritise theft and robbery in the ward, particularly around schools and the Abbey Road crossing. SNT officers will utilise the ward’s police and council CCTV units to identify and track offenders and gather evidence. Plain clothes patrols will be considered around hot spot areas of the ward, with cross border working alongside relevant teams in other wards and boroughs to locate and arrest suspects. ‘Look Up, Look Out’ leaflets will be handed out, with this message promoted in the ward’s schools when officers attend for assemblies.

SNT will work with the specialist burglary team to get the best results for residents affected by burglary as we know the impact this has on victims and communities. We will also work with colleagues around London to locate and arrest suspects outside of our ward and borough. Home visits to provide burglary prevention advice will also be offered where time and resources allow.</action><action-date>2025-07-07</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs and ASB</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-07</suggestion-date><issue>Drugs and ASB

The SNT team will build intelligence around potential users and supply, in order to best tackle this problem across the ward. Street briefings and ‘meet the team’ events at Wharncliffe Community Hall will aim to give local residents the confidence to come and speak to officers and provide any information they have which will help build a picture of the issue. Again, where there is enough intelligence, plain clothes operations will be planned with the support of neighbouring wards and specialist teams to disrupt drugs activity and detain offenders.</action><action-date>2025-07-07</action-date></priority></priorities>

However, community feedback and reports received by the team indicate that the residents feel most unsafe in the Dunfield, Lushington and Sedgehill areas

The SNT will continue to carry out targeted patrols in these locations to provide a visible presence and offer reassurance to the community

SNT officers will engage with members of the public to encourage the use of the Street Safe tool to anonymously record the areas of Bellingham in which they feel least safe and why.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>Brief descripition - Barkingside has a main transport hub in GANTS HILL, including busy night life venues. Due to the area covering a busy Underground Station, and a variety of community shops, a priority includes tackling Violence Related Offences especially surrounding areas of Violence Against Women And Girls (VAWG). 
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>Actions

SPECIFIC: Reduce the fear of assaults by members of the public in public places across Barkingside, including Gants Hill Underground Station, Cranbrook Road, Eastern Avenue and Woodford Avenue. To also gain public confidence in local Policing. 

MEASURABLE: Success can be measured by the declination of number of reported incidents to Police and positive feedback during community events and engagements with members of the community. This enables Police to seek community opinions, concerns and queries regarding the hotspot areas mentioned in the latter.

ACHIEVABLE: Ensure members of the community feel safe and can safely use the locations. Focus is on working with the community including other agencies such as TFL and Redbridge Enforcement, carry out high Vis and plain clothes patrols, VAWG walk and talks, community contact session and stalls set up in busy areas. 
RELEVANT: Ensure members of the community can safely use the public locations and the public subway. 

TIMELY: The period between ward panel meetings will be used to monitor the success of this problem-solving process. Resources will also be taken into consideration, Review to take place prior to ward panel meetings which are held 4 times per year. Surveys are also sent out to ward residents to obtain opinions or concerns that are used to monitor success rates of neighbourhood policing.  
</action><action-date>2025-06-29</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB and Vagrancy</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>Brief description - Gants Hill Underground station serves as the main transport hub in Barkingside, that serves hundreds members of Public due to its direct link into Central London. Gants Hill Underground is also situated at a busy roundabout junction, that correspondingly attracts vagrancy, begging and general ASB at the traffic lights and subway underpasses.
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>Actions

SPECIFIC: To reduce the number of rough sleepers that beg at public places at Gants Hill and the subway underpasses. General ASB creates a detrimental impact to the quality of life on the ward especially to the local community and residents, regarding feelings of their safety in the area especially during the night. 

MEASURABLE:  This can be measured on reporting incidents to Police and feedback during the community events, drop in surgery, community contact session at Gants hill Library.  Monitoring the status of prolific offenders in the area through the usage of Anti-social Behaviour Tickets, Community Protection Warnings and Notices. 

ACHIEVABLE: The persistent usage of Dispersal orders under section 35-39 of Anti-Social Behaviour and Crime and Policing Act 2014. Utilising powers and legislation enables Officers to disperse Prolific Offenders for 48 hours especially as the area has a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO). Further action and contingencies include the usage of issuing ASB- anti-social behaviour warnings, Community Protection Warnings, and Community Protection Notices. Targeting late night high visibility patrols alongside collaborative joint patrol with REO Redbridge Enforcement Officers and BTP-British Transport Police. 

RELEVANT: Ensure members of the community can safely use the public locations, public subway (underpass).

TIMELY: Following up all procedures to resolve this issue on a timely schedule. Stage one includes ASB warnings, Stage 2 of Community Protection Warnings and stage 3, a Community Protection Notice. Monitoring the usage of these methods will enable prolific offenders to be dispersed from the area and therefore reduce anti-social behaviour.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-13</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY:

To reduce knife-enabled watch robberies in the streets surrounding Brompton Road and Sloane Street.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police.

This can be achieved by operations targeting robbery hotspot areas, high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through crime prevention advice and engagement via social media.

This issue has historically been prevalent across AW BCU, and previous years have seen the number of offences rising in the warmer summer months, when victim's watches are more likely to be visible. A number of these offences have received viral coverage on social media, and this type of crime continues to be a matter of concern for Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every 3 months).
</issue><issue-date>2025-07-13</issue-date><action>Proactive and plain-clothes operations have been carried out across the AW BCU involving officers from specialist police units, which have resulted in the arrest of a number of suspects for watch robbery offences.

Officers have also been running regular crime prevention stands, promoting initiatives such as the 'Look up, look out' campaign.</action><action-date>2025-07-13</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-13</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce Theft From Motor Vehicle offences in Hans Place, Egerton Gardens and Lowndes Square.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, plain-clothes deployments in conjunction with pursuit-trained units, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through crime prevention advice via social media/leaflet drops and working with RBKandC Council to install signage/CCTV on affected streets.

The number of these type of offences has previously peaked over the winter months, leading up to and following on from Christmas. Crime figures show that levels of this type of crime had reduced on the ward by around 50% since Winter 2023, however it is still one of the most prevalent offences on the ward, and recently in February and March 2025 there was a marked increase in these crimes. This concern is shared by Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).</issue><issue-date>2025-07-13</issue-date><action>Proactive patrols carried out over the past 12 months as part of Op LUBBOCHI, and more recently intelligence-led patrols linked to a prolific suspect for these offences, who was arrested in March.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through effective use of cocooning visits, crime prevention advice via social media and face-to-face community engagement events.

This number of these type of offences has previously risen over the summer months, when some homes are unoccupied with people away on holiday, and windows left open due to warmer weather. Historically this type of crime also tends to increase in the months leading up to Christmas.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>Concerns continue to be raised by the community about drug dealing within the WINDRUSH SQUARE area and the use of drugs on the surrounding residential roads such as Brixton Road (O/S Brixton LT station), Electric Avenue, Atlantic Road, and Brixton Road towards the LT station, Windrush Square, Rushcroft Road, Coldharbour Lane, Saulton Road, Mervan Road, Effra Road etc. 

This also leads to rough sleeping on front door steps and damage to property. In response to this officers and partner agencies will perform a number of targeted patrols in and around the Town Centre at peak times
</issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>Officer Uplift for Brixton Windrush: We’ve recently welcomed two new members of our team, meaning that we’ve now got 3 x PCs and 3 x PCSOs. On their shift days, this enables to the officers to divide and patrol in more areas to increase visibility. 

Daily Patrols/CPWs: 
When on shift, the Brixton Windrush Officers are conducting daily patrols in and around the Ward primarily focusing on the Town Centre as that’s where our highest concentration of issues occur. Whilst out on patrol, officers are engaging with repeat offenders and issuing CPWs and CPNs to those who require enforcement. 

Days Of Action: 
The Team take part in monthly muti-agency Days of Action in ASB Hotspots across the Ward. 

Tackling the Handling of Stolen Goods:  
Officers visited 102 shops in the Town Centre to hand deliver letters and warn businesses about the dangers of handling stolen goods. We did this because we recognise that shoplifting is often a bi-product of drug use and we’re hoping to reduce the demand for stolen goods and make it harder for offenders to offload stolen goods. </action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) </suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>As ever this remains a priority and is a specific BCU priority. SNT officers will make VAWG an operational priority across the Ward and look for innovative ways to deliver better results. SNT officers will increase external scrutiny of our response; making sure that engagement with women and girls and the voluntary and community sector, continuous and deeper than it has been before.
</issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>Walk and Talk with local women: 
Officers are encoraging women to join SNT officers on a reassurance patrol in the area. On the Walk and Talk, we'll offer advice on how to contact us and how to keep yourself safe in the local area. </action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Anti-Social Behaviour</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>We're aware of high levels of Anti Social Behaviour on our Ward.

</issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>Days Of Action: 
The Team take part in monthly muti-agency Days of Action in ASB Hotspots across the Ward. 

ASB Reports: 
For every ASB report we receive, we make contact with the informant and gain any and all relevant intel to inform our strategy. 

Zero Tolerance Approach: 

Whilst out on patrol, officers have a zero tolerance approach to those commiting ASB. Offenders are being issued CPWs, CPNs and pushing for Arrest where proportionate.</action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority></priorities>

Mapesbury and Cricklewood SNT will continue to show uniform patrols along Cricklewood Broadway and Chichele Road as this is the hotspot for violence on the streets. Embedded with this is Operation Terminos focusing on Violence, however Operation Terminos 2.0 will commence in May to focus on driving down violence further. The SNT have been working closely with Barnet Cricklewood SNT to provide uniformed patrols. Violence in the area has decreased however this will still be a main focus to show police presence and try to identify suspects through CCTV footage.

Burglary on the ward is decreasing. Compared to this time last year burglaries are down. We are constantly identifying burglars and disrupting there activity to prevent further offences and the damage it has on victims lives. We continue to visit those victims who have been burgled to provide reassurance and to seize any cctv footage at an early stage of the investigation so that if the suspect is identified by officers they are apprehended at the earliest opportunity. With this we try to attach criminal behaviour orders or community protection warnings/notices against the suspects identified in order for them to stop this criminal behaviour as it has a significant impact on the victims.
</issue><issue-date>2025-07-07</issue-date><action>Provide both uniformed and plain clothes patrols, identify individuals who have been identified as suspects for burglaries and disrupt them. Engage with them and if any offences committed to arrest them.

Anti-social behaviour is an issue across London. There are some hotspot areas, which the SNT are aware of where people loiter and use drugs. Working closely with the local authority enables them to challenge these individuals and to provide them with strong words of advice. If there anti-social behaviour continues, they will be receive a formal warning. The team also conduct days of actions with the local authority. Any continued anti-social behaviour issues the team will look at taking action to known individuals that keep causing problems, this could be from issuing community protection warnings, community protection notices and criminal behaviour orders. Drug use is the main concern where it is suspected that drug users commit crime in order to fund their drug habit. We are working closely with services that can support drug users so that they can receive the necessary help.

M: Measured by the number of such crimes reported to police.
A: This can be achieved by intelligence led hotspot-based policing, along with using said intelligence to identify trends in offending. We will also continue to signpost crime prevention advice, and offer guidance on target-hardening to reduce the potential of opportunist offenders.
R: This is an issue that is of great concern to residents across RBKC. Burglary also falls in line with our partner agencies priorities across the Borough and remains a relevant topic of our Ward Panel. As such, it remains a priority.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-02</suggestion-date><issue>ASB caused by moped/scrambler bike riders in Central Park will remain a ward priority over the summer months, with the park expected to see an increase in visitors. As part of a planned tie-in with after-school patrols, Central Park will be visited, with the late afternoons and weekends in mind, to detect and deter mopeds being used in the park. With 11 access points, directly preventing entry to vehicles has been a challenge. Previous efforts from the team have seen an Environmental Visual Audit (EVA) requested to seek means to restrict illegal access without hindering legitimate visitors. As well as the increased presence, the team will act on any information provided in relation to individuals believed involved in ASB around Central Park and neighbouring Fels Field. The opening 22 days of May recorded 7.84 miles of foot patrol around Central Park during the times most likely to witness ASB, while 3 consecutive after-school patrols in June saw more than 4 miles covered. While no vehicles have been stopped to-date, two separate incidents have resulted in offenders leaving the park on seeing police and stemming any negative impact.

</issue><issue-date>2025-07-02</issue-date><action>
Drug use in Central Park, particularly within the 3 car parks, will also be a focus this summer, with officers providing a presence and conducting searches where grounds exist. This will be part of a wider project to make the park a safer, more hospitable place to visit, especially with many of the anticipated park-goers throughout July and August consisting of young families making use of the 5 play areas dotted around the site. 
</action><action-date>2025-07-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>College-based ASB and Drug Use</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-02</suggestion-date><issue>The service road opposite Barking and Dagenham College on Dagenham Road will receive additional attention from June after reports of college students gathering in the area. A once-hotspot for cannabis use, the route leading towards Parish Fields and beyond into the Eastbrookend Country Park has reportedly seen a recent increase in gatherings. While the team have routinely patrolled Harveys Lane throughout the years, an additional presence will now be provided, with individuals spoken to and, where justified, stopped and searched.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-02</issue-date><action>Two-wheeled vehicle-based anti-social behaviour (ASB) and two recent robberies earlier on in the year will form the basis for continued patrols of the park, with keys times for these issues factored in. As part of a planned tie-in with after school patrols, Central Park will be visited to provide safety for students passing through, while the late afternoon, along with weekends, will see a greater presence to detect and deter mopeds being driven in the park. With 10 access points to the park, preventing entry to vehicles will be a challenge. Previous efforts have seen an Environmental Visual Audit (EVA) requested to seek means to restrict illegal access without hindering legitimate visitors to the park. The team will look to act on any information provided in relation to individuals believed involved in ASB around Central Park and neighbouring Fels Field.</action><action-date>2025-07-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Robbery and Violence Against Women and Girls</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-02</suggestion-date><issue>After-school patrols around Central Park will play a key role in deterring robbery over the next 12 weeks. The park, which has recorded 4 incidents of phones being targeted from school-aged children since February, acts as a cut-through for students heading home. As with most open spaces, the vast, somewhat isolated nature of Central Park lends itself to opportunities for robbery and so a focused on-foot approach will be employed, along with engaging with groups of youths to identify concerns. Similarly, the park will also see a uniformed presence from the late afternoon to offer reassurance to women and girls using the park, either recreationally or as a means to get home. The team will make itself available for feedback, both in person and online via its Facebook, X and Met Engage platforms. While reports of VAWG-related incidents within the park remain low, maintaining a high level of confidence for female visitors will be the measure of success. More than 4 miles of the park was covered on foot across 3 days in early June, with after-school and after-work demographics in mind. </issue><issue-date>2025-07-02</issue-date><action>Eastbrook and Rush Green ward continues to be a safe place to live and visit, with violent incidents in public places among the borough’s lowest. The team have continued to provide a precautionary presence around Rush Green’s Barking and Dagenham College, a potential hotspot for robbery given the high number of young people attending the venue, along with coverage of open spaces, with a recent patrol in March taking in 2.5 miles of the Eastbrookend Country Park and surrounding area. Early evening foot patrols remain a staple of the SNT’s efforts to provide reassurance for those heading home to the ward after work, which has included Footpath 155, a cut-through between Rush Green Road and Gorseway often used by residents.</action><action-date>2025-07-02</action-date></priority></priorities>

Most recently one of the males arrested is now currently in prison after an arrest by the team, another was arrested when found with class A drugs and a third was arrested for weapons offensives.
The team is also utilising CBOs, CPNS and ASB warning notices to disrupt these gang nominal by restricting which locations they can visit and who they can associate with, which so far is proving to be effective. The team has noted the robberies in North Feltham appear to be targeting electric bikes and e-scooters, with suspects usually wearing balaclavas and working in groups. The team will increase patrols near to Feltham Train Station and Feltham Park.

This has the added bonus of further disrupting drug dealers, as these type of vehicle prove to be popular mode of transport for them.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-03</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and burglary
To reduce incidents of Robbery and burglary in the Earl’s Court area.
Measurable: the incidences of robbery and burglary can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, and ASB reports relating to robbery and attempted robbery.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by the continuation of high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, vehicle patrols, variation of shifts to include late and night shifts, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening. We also provide crime prevention advice and engagement via social media. Earl’s Court SNT officers regularly change their shifts to combat robbery and burglary, and conduct stop and search where grounds exist.  Robbery and burglary patrols are conducted on the Earls Court Road and surrounding streets. The Earls Court ward panel members are often given crime prevention advice regarding knife point robberies.   
Plain clothes operations can be considered with neighbouring wards to further disrupt robbery if need be.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-03</issue-date><action>SNT conduct regular proactive patrols around the ward at all times of the day.

Measurable: this can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, intelligence reports, and ASB reports relating to drugs, as well as the anecdotal evidence seen by officers, WP members and local residents.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by a combination of high-visibility patrols within the highlighted area, joint working with RBKC wardens officers, robust enforcement of PSPO legislation and effective use of CPW/CPN to  offenders. Earl’s Court officers have been proactive in obtaining two very successful warrants recently, recovering approx. £30,000 of drugs. Drug users have reported that the area is currently ‘too hot’ for drugs and they are going elsewhere. Local drug users are regularly stopped and searched, leading to a number of arrests and community resolutions. The drug hotspots in Earls Court are around Nevern Square, Nevern Place, Trebovir Road and Templeton Place. These areas are patrolled when officers are on duty. Further drug warrants are planned to combat the supply of drugs in Earls Court.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-03</issue-date><action>SNT approach drug issues using a multi pronged approach.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-07</suggestion-date><issue>This priority is aimed at reducing the street robberies in and around the Winstanley Estate area. In particular, any streets or public greens such as York Gardens which serve as a thoroughfare for commuters egressing from Clapham Junction who may find themselves as victims of personal robbery, in particular during the hours of darkness later in the year.
Ongoing patrols where our late turn shifts allow serve as a good point to deal with this.
In addition, utilising support from other resources and teams such as the new Neighbourhood Tasking Team, and the Territorial Support Group will assist us in dealing with such issues.

This is not bespoken to one particular area of our ward, instead it is found to exist in multiple areas across the BCU
DWO’s will map out each crime using Met Insights / PlanWeb, and using this data, we will be able to work out hotspots and as such, co-ordinate patrols effectively.
When at each hotspot, and circumstance permitting, officers will make good use of Stop and Search, and where applicable, good use of the information sharing agreement with the council may assist in dealing with those most troublesome.
ASB comes in many form - such as, noise disturbances from addresses engaged in drug dealing, loitering in and around these areas thus putting neighbours in fear of harm, urination / defecation in stairwells and other public access areas of buildings, graffiti. The list is non exhaustive.
Where we identify addresses that are causing ASB issues and where drugs are the nucleus, we can use ASB powers to good use - such as Closure Orders under Section 80 of the ASB Act of 2014.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery
Furzedown encompasses Graveney School, Furzedown Recreation Ground and Tooting Bec Athletic Track, where we see a rise in Robbery offences in these locations compared to the rest of the ward. Furzedown borders both Mitcham and Streatham so we see that that these offences are commonly enabled by suspects travelling on mopeds from outside of the ward boundaries.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>We police by being intelligence and data led, which shows us that the number of juveniles travelling to and from school have become victims of this crime, during after school hours and throughout the weekend. Robbery offences are also more prevalent in the summer months, which is why it is part of our Summer 2025 crime plan to tackle this problem. We have a Dedicated Ward Officer- Children and Young Person specialist who is an officer that specialises with youth crime and they have a good relationship with Graveney School to provide support for vulnerable victims and to make sure the students are being given crime prevention advice. As part of Operation Nomad we also have several police cameras in the area which have been in place for over a year, these allow us to easily view footage and provide quick time evidence for any offences that have been reported to the police, this may include suspect descriptions such a being able to view the VRM of a moped if it has been used to enable the crime. We will measure our success by analysing data to determine if there has been a reduction in Robbery offences.</action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>During our ward panel meeting residents have raised concerns that there have been a number of theft from motor vehicles, these commonly occur during the night but do also happen during daylight hours. Suspects have been seen walking down the road trying door handles, which is an offence of Motor Vehicle Interference if it is with the intent to steal the vehicle or something inside it. We also have reports of windows being smashed to steal the contents inside the vehicle. These offences are not specific to any part of the ward, but they have been mostly reported on residential streets between Mitcham Lane and Rectory Lane. </issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>This is a priority for the residents and as part of our Neighbourhood guarantee we are making it our priority to tackle crimes that are impacting the residents. We are in direct contact with residents, to receive fast time intelligence when it is known that suspects are out and committing these offences. This allows us to better focus our plain clothed operations on streets that are being targeted, so our patrol areas may change. We have previously looked at the data to have a better understanding of what time these offences are being committed and changed our shifts so that we are available to conduct proactive patrols during these hours. We will be flexible and continue to see if this is needed to reduce the crime. If anybody recognises an individual committing this offence then please remember to send your information to crime stoppers by using their website as it may help us to identify suspects. </action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Anti-Social Behaviour</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-10</suggestion-date><issue>Anti-Social Behaviour can encompass a number of issues, this is one of our priorities due to the number of reports that have been raised to us by residents. These include Furzedown Recreation ground where we have received reports of youths smoking cannabis and stolen mopeds being ridden across the ground. Another current issue is mopeds and cyclists riding on the paved area where Eardley Road meets Blegborough Road, causing a dangers to pedestrians and also drug related offences in Mosyer Court and Fayland Avenue.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-10</issue-date><action>Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour requires ongoing engagement from the team to reduce the issues and keep them from reoccurring so that it has a minimal impact on the community. We are committed to keeping up to date with any intelligence surrounding drug dealing in the ward, we have used the intelligence to execute drug warrants to disrupt drug dealers and reduce drug use in the area. When dealing the with the reported ASB of mopeds being ridden off road in the Recreation Ground and on Eardley Road we have utilised our powers under the Road Traffic Act as well as using other policing powers when appropriate, such as issuing ASB warnings, Community Protection Warnings and Community Protection Notices, these can be issued to specific individuals who have been reported to us. Throughout this we have been in contact with the council around their plans to implement extra measures to block the pavement on Eardly road to ensure pedestrian safety and we plan to conduct a traffic operation to coincide with the changes that are taking place to deter road users from using the pavement. </action><action-date>2025-07-10</action-date></priority></priorities>

Whether this be protecting public in relation to VAWG offences, or ensuring the PSPO is adhered to, and anti social behaviour dealt with robustly. To achieve this, we aim to decrease drug and alcohol use and drug dealing (including through use of cars, mopeds, e-scooters, and bicycles in an around all public parks and recreational grounds. A recurring trend during ward panel meetings is residence and school children feeling unsafe to enter public spaces, and we insist this must not be the case.  </issue><issue-date>2025-07-07</issue-date><action>1 – Kenton and Preston SNT have carried out and will continue to carry out proactive patrols in parks and open spaces through-out Kenton. These patrols have increased and the results are reflective of this. In one park alone in a single day, 3 cannabis detections were made within the space of a few hours. These patrols will continue, with the aim of identifying the offenders, and letting them know that Kenton open spaces are not the places from criminal and anti-social activity. 
2 – Kenton will be increasing their surgeries and community contact sessions being held in parks and open spaces, allowing residence to attend and speak with their local bobbies. 
3 – Kenton SNT have assisted the ward panel chair to achieve a suitable outcome, of the demolition of Lidding Road garages, a hotspot for anti-social and illegal activity, spilling out into the Woodcock Park open space.  
4 – Kenton and Preston have made a number of changes to their shifts to be available and present during times where anti-social and illegal activity is known to peak during twilight hours. 
5 – We will be holding at least once a month a dedicated VAWG contact session, where we will encourage people to come forward with concerns or questions and be offering advice where possible.

This includes dangerous vehicle driving in private carparks, the use of vehicle on foot paths and through pedestrian gates, and the general use of vehicles in crime, including drug dealing, robberies and burglaries. </issue><issue-date>2025-07-07</issue-date><action>1 – Kenton SNT take a zero tolerance approach to the anti social use of vehicles. This is being tackled by the use of anti-social vehicle warnings being issued to vehicles and drivers based of evidence provided to the police from residents and business owners. These warnings, if breached may result in the seizure of the vehicle, incurring release fee’s and penalties. All residents are encouraged to submit any evidence of anti-social vehicle use to Kenton SNT so these or similar actions can be taken.

Measurable: Reduce drug related incidents in targeted enclosed spaces over a 3 month period. Conduct regular hi visibility reassurance patrols and take positive action where offences identified.

Achievable: Complete targeted patrols and engage with residents to encourage community reporting.

Relevant: Drug use in enclosed spaces harms residents quality of life and undermines community safety. Addressing this supports the Metropolitan Police Service’s goals of reducing harm, protecting vulnerable people and improving trust and confidence in the Police.

Time-bound: Implement over a 3-month period, with a formal review and evaluation from Ward Panel members at the next Ward Panel meeting.</action><action-date>2025-07-03</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Public Order Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-03</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce public order offences in Lillie</issue><issue-date>2025-07-03</issue-date><action>Specific: Reduce incidents of public order offences— such as aggressive behaviour and verbal abuse in Lillie Ward’s public spaces by targeting hotspot areas, engaging with community groups, and increasing police presence.

Measurable: Increase engagement within community spaces and utilise all available police powers including Community Protection Warnings and Notices.

Achievable: DWOs to engage with the local community, intervene early, and use enforcement tools when necessary. Work with community groups and local services to identify repeat offenders and resolve underlying issues.

Relevant Public order issues negatively affect perceptions of safety and discourage community space use. Tackling this issue supports the Metropolitan Police Service’s wider goals around neighbourhood policing.

Time-bound: Implement over a 3-month period, with a formal review and evaluation from Ward Panel members at the next Ward Panel meeting.</action><action-date>2025-07-03</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Violent Crime Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-03</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce violent crime offences in Lillie</issue><issue-date>2025-07-03</issue-date><action>	Specific: Reduce violent crime incidents in Lillie Ward by focusing on hotspot areas, identifying and targeting repeat offenders, and working closely with community partners to prevent escalation, especially around youth violence and weapon carrying.

Measurable: Reduce violent crime incidents over the next 3 months. Increase stop and search and complete at least 3 weapon sweeps in hot spots.

Achievable: Combine uniform patrols, intelligence, community engagement, and partnership working (e.g. youth services, housing, CCTV teams). Use weapon sweeps, and targeted enforcement on known offenders or groups.

Relevant: Violent crime, particularly involving weapons or group violence, poses a direct threat to public safety. This work supports our goals on reducing harm, protecting victims, and strengthening community trust.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-03</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERIES
S. To reduce the amount of robberies on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of robberies happen near to Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road. This is due to residents/non-residents attending the area and visiting local bars and restaurant’s. Members of public are then normally targeted walking home from venues in off streets from the main roads.

A. Though Plain Cloths operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. A mobile CCTV camera has been requested from the council and placed on the junction of Old Brompton Road and Drayton Gardens to tackle the issue. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Creswell Place and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. Robberies appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. 

T. To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting.

Statistic’s are showing a slight rise in high value residential Burglaries, which are being targeted. Entrance through windows is common place by force using blunt tools....and using scaffolding to access neighbours..
 ***Garage burglaries have shown an increase***
SMART:-
Specific  –  Prevent and Reduce Cycle and vehicle ASB on the whole ward but specifically near Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and Edith Grove.
Measurable – Measure through, statistic crime reports, trend mapping and calls to police (Crimes recorded).
Achievable – Attained through preventative high visibility patrols in key areas along with operations.
Relevant – Due to the personal nature of the crime this is a top ward priority. 
Timely – This will be measured and reviewed at the next ward panel meeting (every three months)</issue><issue-date>2025-07-03</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2025-07-03</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Motor Vehicle crime</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-03</suggestion-date><issue>S: Reduce the amount of MV Crime, but numbers are currently High.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY – Violence Related Priority

Ward Priority 1 - Violence 
This is the MPS priority set in the ward panel.
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on a greater awareness of Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG).
The police will specifically conduct proactive engagement with the relevant demographics and other demographics who wish to highlight issues. A minimum of two events will be held within the ward and one of these will operate in the vicinity of Rayners Lane Tube Station.
The team will gather relevant information about where people feel unsafe and also address the perception of crime. A comprehensive intelligence and information picture will be developed over the period which will be presented to the ward panel and will be analysed to establish if there are available interventions
This process is intended to better understand the problem, previous interactions of this nature have been well received and well attended and therefore this should be achievable
This links to violence and the fear of violence, it is therefore relevant
This engagement will commence for three months and should be sufficient time to develop an understanding of local issues
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>Rayners Lane SNT PC's and PCSO have conducted regular mobile and foot patrols across the ward during various times of the day. We have completed daily weapons sweeps at various locations especially at hot spots, such as service roads on ALEXANDRA AVENUE and concealed staircases.
 
Operation GOODRICH: Local ward officers have been patrolling RAYNERS LANE STATION to engage with girls and women to make them aware about the VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) and issue literature, give advice and encourage women and girls to report any unsafe streets on STREET SAFE.
</action><action-date>2025-06-29</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 2 - Substance Abuse</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>The SNT will target offenders abusing substances in the ward, utilising Achilles heels tactics to disrupt and deter offending, including use of the Public Space Protection Order.
Where intelligence is received about supply or use, the team will actively use all powers available to disrupt these offenders and obtain evidence of these offences.
Officers will continue to engage with the community to identify areas where these issues are prevalent, including engaging with local businesses and enforcing licence conditions for the sale of alcohol.

The SNT will record encounters and present these results to the ward panel 

Officers will be present in the community and come across issues for substance abuse, paying specific attention to these problems will make this goal achievable.

This has been sighted as an issue on the survey and by the ward panel and therefore it is relevant

This priority has been set for 3 months and will be reviewed at the next Ward panel meeting on 15/08/25
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>Patrols in area known for the most drug use, such as, Alexander Avenue and Rayner Lane and Community Protection Warnings and Community Protection Notices will be issued to nominals known to police for drug. 
Research and intelligence gathering underway for consideration of targeted individuals and addresses for enforcement action.  High visibility Patrols taken place in locations where the majority of incidents take place.  Local contact with residents and local shop keepers to alleviate their concerns. 

Street briefings across roads where issues have occurred to notify public of police action and for intelligence gathering.  
</action><action-date>2025-06-29</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 3 - Burglary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on the prevention and detection of burglaries.
The police will specifically identify all allegations of burglary within the ward, including both residential and non-residential burglaries. The team will complete local enquiries and complete CCTV trawls in order to identify suspect leads and contribute towards investigations of these offences.
The team will identify the most prolific offenders and use Achilles heels tactics with these individuals to remove their opportunity to commit these offences.
The team will proactively engage and support the priority crime unit to assist with their investigations and help to develop linked series of offences where there are opportunities to do so.
The team will actively promote crime prevention advice for specified roads within the ward that are a greater risk of Asian Gold thefts which are known to increase at this time of year.
The proactive operation will be led by the team targeting offenders, crime prevention is a within the capacity of the team to deliver and therefore this is achievable
The panel have elected this priority, this has been corroborated by the ward panel survey and it is relevant to the local area.
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>The team have attended and completed follow up visits to all victims of burglary who reside within the ward. The officers have been completing CCTV trawls and gathering intelligence to determine offending patters and similar methods to maximise the quality of investigations.

Officers have been using powers to search suspects for stolen property, and for articles going equipped to steal within the ward.

</issue><issue-date>2025-07-07</issue-date><action>S-   Young males involved in drug trade and use around Churchill Gardens Estate

M- A mixture of HI VIZ and plain clothed patrols targeting areas where drug use occurs. There will also be attendance at youths clubs on the estate as well as crime prevention stands within the estate. There maybe partnership working with local council and proactive units.

A- Through the targeted patrols and partnership working, we can see a reduction in youth drug activity.

R- This is an issue consistent with other large high rise estates with tower blocks across London.

T-This is ongoing and we will review results monthly from viewing CONNECT reports and speaking with members of the community.

Both are green spaces that have history of attracting ASB related issues causing concerns for residents.

M- Targeted patrols of both locations in HI viz and plain clothes alongside partner agencies such as the local authority when required.

A- A reduction in ASB related calls and CONNECT reports would evidence positive engagement.

R- These ASB issues are not isolated to the above areas, however do have a follow on effect on other areas close by.

T- Would review reports, CADs, CONNECTS weekly to confirm any reductions in ASB, although this would still be a long term project.

M- HI VIZ patrols in the areas mentioned above, STT to conduct operations with NPT to tackle the cycling on the pavement.

A- Through partnership working, the patrols and operations should see a reduction in vehicle ASB.

R- These issues occur across London, however locally, results would greatly benefit the local community.

T- Feedback from residents and a reduction in CONNECT asb's would evidence results. This is an ongoing issue and a timeframe not applicable.

Previous Sydenham SNT action plan was to reduce the number of outstanding offenders on the ward. At the time of writing this the number of outstanding offenders is at zero (0).
Sydenham has recently been flagged as an emerging violence with injury and knife crime hotspot, due to a flurry of reports in the last month, three (3) known to have knives involved.

Actions:
SNT officers will increase patrols in the specific areas identified where offences have occurred to gather information to inform targeted stop and search action, and potential warrants. These actions will be reviewed on 30/09/2025.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-15</suggestion-date><issue>The prevention of motor vehicle crime remains a significant focus due to ongoing reports of theft from vehicles and the theft of high-value keyless entry vehicles. The ward panel has agreed that this issue warrants continued attention and resources.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-15</issue-date><action>Hotspot Monitoring The team will consistently monitor crime reports related to motor vehicle incidents, focusing on identified hotspot areas to implement targeted patrols.
 
Both high-visibility and plainclothes officers will patrol areas known for motor vehicle crime, particularly during times when such crimes are most likely to occur.
 
Officers will personally contact victims of motor vehicle crime to offer relevant crime prevention advice, ensuring they feel supported and informed. This outreach will also provide valuable insights into community concerns and experiences.
 
The team will enhance awareness efforts by utilising the ward's Twitter account, monthly newsletter, and community events to share crime prevention tips related to vehicle security and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
 
Overall, these strategies aim to create a safer environment in St Anns by engaging with the community, fostering trust, and ensuring a proactive police presence to deter crime effectively.

Officers have been patrolling the above areas regularly to monitor the ASB issues.
We will continue to patrol the location to reduce ASB by giving out ASB warnings, Community Protection Notice (CPNs) stops and searches and arrest if necessary.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-29</suggestion-date><issue>Shoplifting offences account for the largest proportion of all crime recorded on the ward. The Nugent Retail Park in SMC is known as a hotpot for shoplifting offences and is a significant crime generator. With a large number of retail outlets, the area is frequented by prolific, priority offenders, known to police to be drug dependent who often offend to fund their addiction. Items stolen include cosmetics, meat, alcohol and certain medium to high value clothing. The area is also known for persons approaching shoppers, asking for money in the street, or when standing at cashpoints. They can be verbally aggressive with members of the public who decline to give them money. These crimes and ASB place additional demand on local policing and discourages members of the public from shopping at the location, which in turn has a negative effect upon trade.</issue><issue-date>2025-06-29</issue-date><action>Regular uniformed patrols are carried out along with targeted plain clothes tasking.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-05-30</suggestion-date><issue>Drug use and its associated anti-social behaviour have seen a rise in our ward, and the negative impact that this has on communities has been reflected in conversations held with community members. Regular patrols will take place targeting hotspot locations and utilising stop and search powers. The team will also build a greater intelligence picture regarding drug supply on our ward, to enable pro-active enforcement measures.</issue><issue-date>2025-05-30</issue-date><action>	Over the past 6 months, our ward has experienced a noticeable rise in drug-related activity and associated anti-social behaviour (ASB). As neighbourhood police officers, we are aware of the negative impact such behaviour has on the quality of life of our residents, particularly when it becomes entrenched in specific localities. In response, our team has taken a firm and proactive approach to clamp down on these behaviours, with a strategy focused on hotspot policing, regular high-visibility patrols, targeted stop and search activity, and intelligence-led disruption of local drug supply networks.
1)	Targeting Hotspot Locations
Key to our approach has been identifying and targeting known hotspots within the ward—areas that consistently attract drug use or drug dealing. One such area is Pratt Street, which borders St Martin’s Gardens, as well as the Curnock Estate, locations frequently associated with visible drug use and related disorder. Recognising the pattern of activity in this area, we have ensured increased patrols through and around the gardens, as well as the estate, on foot, ensuring that there is always high visibility. These patrols have not only acted as a deterrent but have also allowed officers to engage with residents and build stronger community rapport.
The impact of this targeted presence has already been seen. Reports of drug use in and around Curnock Estate have decreased significantly. Residents have commented positively on our regular visibility and the increased sense of safety in the area, particularly during evenings and weekends when concerns were previously at their highest.
2)	Stop and Search – Proactive Policing
As part of our proactive efforts, we have also made effective use of stop and search powers. This has been conducted in line with best practice, intelligence-led, respectful, and professional, ensuring that public confidence is maintained while addressing the problem robustly.
A notable example occurred recently on Pratt Street, where a satisfactory stop and search was conducted in a location known for regular drug-related activity. The subject was found to be in possession of cannabis, which was seized. More importantly, the interaction led to the subject providing valuable intelligence on drug dealing activity in other nearby locations. This illustrates the dual benefit of stop and search: both the immediate disruption of offences and the longer-term development of our local intelligence picture.
On the same day, a further satisfactory stop and search was conducted outside of the St Francis Crick institute. This took place in broad daylight, and again cannabis was seized. The timing and location of these searches highlight growing concerns about public drug use during daytime hours, suggesting a shift in user confidence and patterns of behaviour. As a result, we have adjusted our patrol strategy, accordingly, increasing visibility in this area and using stop and search not just to enforce, but also to reassure law-abiding members of the public.

3)	Intelligence Led Enforcement 
The development and use of local intelligence has been key in our fight against drug-related activity. Every interaction, whether during a stop and search or community engagement has contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of dealer behaviour and areas of vulnerability. By analysing patterns and feeding intelligence into wider borough policing operations, we are increasingly able to disrupt the street dealing side of the issue, not just the visible effects.

This intelligence led approach has allowed us to identify emerging hotspots quickly, anticipate potential issues, and deploy patrols with greater strategic purpose. Working in tandem with our Camden Council colleagues, we have been able to action areas of concern and initiate broader investigations based on the groundwork laid through neighbourhood policing.

4)	Increased Visibility and Public Reassurance
Alongside enforcement, we have placed a renewed emphasis on visibility and approachability. As neighbourhood officers, we recognise that our presence alone can act as a powerful deterrent to low-level crime and ASB, while also providing much-needed reassurance to the public.
Over the past few months, we have made a concerted effort to ensure officers are highly visible throughout the day, particularly in areas of concern and during peak times. Officers have conducted foot patrols in parks, residential streets, and near local businesses, providing a calming presence and an opportunity for genuine engagement with the community.
We’ve spoken with numerous residents who have expressed their appreciation for our increased presence. Many have told us that seeing us out and about has boosted morale and made them feel safer in their own neighbourhoods. This kind of feedback reinforces the importance of a balanced approach, one that combines enforcement with empathy, presence with purpose.

5)	Ongoing Commitment to Safer Neighbourhoods 
The work to combat drug related ASB is ongoing. While progress has been made, we remain committed to sustaining this effort and adapting as needed. Our approach continues to be flexible, intelligence-driven, and grounded in community partnership.

In the weeks and months ahead, we will:
•	Continue regular patrols in known hotspots and be ready to respond to new ones.
•	Use stop and search proportionately and effectively, based on up-to-date intelligence.
•	Act on community information, recognising residents as essential partners in our efforts.
•	Work closely with partner agencies—including housing, youth services, and outreach teams—to provide holistic support where enforcement alone is not the solution.
•	Engage schools and community leaders to address the root causes of drug use, particularly among young people.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police.
This will be achieved by operations targeting robbery hotspot areas, high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening - crime prevention advice and engagement via social media.</issue><issue-date>2025-05-30</issue-date><action>Officers have been actively engaging with the Detached Youth Team (DYT) of Camden Council and have participated in the delivery of Day Five of the Choices Programme which delivers knife crime awareness seminars to year 10 and 11 students across the borough.  This involves a scenario based seminar involving a knife crime incident in real time.  This presentation looks at the impact of knife crime on everyone involved including the victim, victim’s family, suspect, suspect family, LAS staff, police officers and bystanders.  This work with DYT is ongoing and relationships between DYT and MET continue to grow stronger.  We look to continue our collaborative work with the DYT.

Officers have also targeted an area of high knife crime robbery on the ward.  This lead to an increase in high visibility patrols.  An operation by the proactive team assisted by SNT lead to the arrest of four offenders and a drop in the number of robberies in that area.

Priority
 
The prevention of motor vehicle crime remains a significant focus due to ongoing reports of theft from vehicles and the theft of high-value keyless entry vehicles. The ward panel has agreed that this issue warrants continued attention and resources.

</issue><issue-date>2025-06-17</issue-date><action>The team will enhance awareness efforts by utilising the ward's Twitter account, monthly newsletter, and community events to share crime prevention tips related to vehicle security and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
 
Overall, these strategies aim to create a safer environment in Southgate by engaging with the community, fostering trust, and ensuring a proactive police presence to deter crime effectively.
</action><action-date>2025-06-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Burglary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-06-17</suggestion-date><issue>Priority
Burglary has now become the ward's primary concern, particularly with the onset of longer dark  nights, which have correlated with a slight rise  in burglary incidents. The ward panel recognises the need for a proactive approach to address this issue promptly.
</issue><issue-date>2025-06-17</issue-date><action>Ongoing Action 
 
The team will analyse overnight crime reports to identify trends and potential series of linked burglaries. This information will be compiled into intelligence reports to better inform patrol strategies.
 
Similar to the approach taken with robbery, the team will distribute relevant crime prevention advice through the ward’s social media platforms, monthly newsletter, and directly during community engagement events.
 
Officers will increase their visibility in residential areas, particularly during peak hours for burglaries, to deter potential offenders. Shifts will be changed to meet the peak hours 
 
Organise home visits to residents at risk to educate on home security measures and encourage them to report suspicious activity, fostering a proactive community approach to crime prevention.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-04</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has been identified as a repeat area for robbery occurring in the West End. Soho is a small area relative to other wards in the area, it has a bustling night time economy which many thousands of people come to, primarily over the weekends. Robbery in Soho is mainly fuelled by the night time economy. Intoxicated patrons leaving bars, clubs, and pubs become targets for groups and individuals intent on stealing their personal property. It is a concern of Soho residents and visitors alike, as robbery is a highly invasive and distressing crime to become victim of. The Met has tasked pan-London units to patrol in Soho to combat these violent offences. The West End Proactive Team is the West End’s dedicated team of officers that are out on foot patrol covering the night time economy. They continue to actively target robbery suspects.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-04</issue-date><action>Proactive teams from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group have already been conducting targeted patrols around Soho. This has seen numerous arrests for robbery and related offences, and disrupting those suspected of being involved in violent offences. Officers in Soho will continue to proactively identify offenders and stop robberies from occurring. Using evidence based approaches, targeting specific roads where the majority of offences are known to occur. High visibility patrols will continue to provide reassurance to members of the public, and provide both reactive and proactive elements in combating robbery, so officers are able to quickly attend calls in Soho. Local Ward officers will be hosting crime prevention stalls, and engagement events in busy areas of Soho which anyone is welcome to attend.</action><action-date>2025-07-04</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-07-04</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has seen sporadic but concentrated issues surrounding the blatant use of drugs on the streets. Several areas in Soho have repeatedly had issues with drug users congregating in areas with low foot traffic, doorways and poorly lit areas. Officers are aware and engaging with drug users, who the majority of are vulnerable or living on the streets. Officers have worked alongside the council and outreach services in order to take a longer term non-enforcement action, which in the long run will produce better more time efficient results as opposed to constantly arresting offenders. Some users/offenders are not engaging well with the diversion and assistance routes offered to them so enforcement action will be taken.</issue><issue-date>2025-07-04</issue-date><action>Officers will continue to carry out proactive targeted patrols to problem areas at the times of day identified by residents. Officers to better utilise their stop and search powers coupled with solid information and intelligence submitted by residents and victims of Anti-Social Behaviour. Officers will also continue to make referrals to outreach services to those willing to engage. Officers will be issuing CPWs, CPN,s and eventually CBOs to prolific offenders that cause anti-social behaviour through the use of drugs. For residents, please submit information reports through official Met reporting channels as this information will get filtered to us, and we will use this information to proactively target anti-social behaviour hotspots.

Many of the reports are specific to Cortis Road area and surrounding parade of shops. </issue><issue-date>2025-07-23</issue-date><action>
As part of the neighbourhood guarantee and summer crime plan, West Putney Designated Ward Officers (DWO) will increase high visibility and plain clothes patrols in the areas concerned with the aim of preventing drugs use and deterring criminal activity.  
We will review information on a daily basis to build an intelligence picture that will support the application for drugs warrants from magistrates. We will pursue those persons driving the sales of drugs, make arrests and seek charges from the Crown Prosecution Service. We will work with local youth services and schools to identify young people vulnerable to criminal exploitation and work tirelessly to safeguard them from criminality.
We will make residents aware of the results of our work, enhancing confidence in our community crime fighting approach through Met Engage and encourage residents to continue reporting activity via 101, online reporting and / or crime stoppers 0800 555 111

We have been visiting local shopkeepers to provide guidance around responsible drinking, selling alcohol to intoxicated persons as well as upholding national policies such as 'Check 25' to prevent selling of alcohol to underage persons. We work with council partners such as Trading Standards and Licensing to ensure that alcoholic products being sold are genuine goods.

We continue to encourage local people to report every incident of alcohol related ASB, this may be rowdy behaviour, noise complaints or public urination. We will hold street briefings to allow people to understand how their reports provide direct evidence to support police action such as the issuance of Community Protection Notice (CPN) or Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO)
We will be proactive in taking positive enforcement against repeat offenders whilst signposting early intervention support where appropriate.
