</issue><issue-date>2025-04-23</issue-date><action>1.	To prioritise theft and robbery in the ward, particularly around schools and the Abbey Road crossing. SNT officers will utilise the ward’s police and council CCTV units to identify and track offenders and gather evidence. Plain clothes patrols will be considered around hot spot areas of the ward, with cross border working alongside relevant teams in other wards and boroughs to locate and arrest suspects. ‘Look Up, Look Out’ leaflets will be handed out, with this message promoted in the ward’s schools when officers attend for assemblies.

SNT will work with the specialist burglary team to get the best results for residents affected by burglary as we know the impact this has on victims and communities. We will also work with colleagues around London to locate and arrest suspects outside of our ward and borough. Home visits to provide burglary prevention advice will also be offered where time and resources allow.</action><action-date>2025-04-23</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs and ASB</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-23</suggestion-date><issue>Drugs and ASB

The SNT team will build intelligence around potential users and supply, in order to best tackle this problem across the ward. Street briefings and ‘meet the team’ events at Wharncliffe Community Hall will aim to give local residents the confidence to come and speak to officers and provide any information they have which will help build a picture of the issue. Again, where there is enough intelligence, plain clothes operations will be planned with the support of neighbouring wards and specialist teams to disrupt drugs activity and detain offenders.</action><action-date>2025-04-23</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-06</suggestion-date><issue>Brief descripition - Barkingside has a main transport hub in GANTS HILL, including busy night life venues. Due to the area covering a busy Underground Station, and a variety of community shops, a priority includes tackling Violence Related Offences especially surrounding areas of Violence Against Women And Girls (VAWG). 
</issue><issue-date>2025-04-06</issue-date><action>Actions

SPECIFIC: Reduce the fear of assaults by members of the public in public places across Barkingside, including Gants Hill Underground Station, Cranbrook Road, Eastern Avenue and Woodford Avenue. To also gain public confidence in local Policing. 

MEASURABLE: Success can be measured by the declination of number of reported incidents to Police and positive feedback during community events and engagements with members of the community. This enables Police to seek community opinions, concerns and queries regarding the hotspot areas mentioned in the latter.

ACHIEVABLE: Ensure members of the community feel safe and can safely use the locations. Focus is on working with the community including other agencies such as TFL and Redbridge Enforcement, carry out high Vis and plain clothes patrols, VAWG walk and talks, community contact session and stalls set up in busy areas. 
RELEVANT: Ensure members of the community can safely use the public locations and the public subway.

</action><action-date>2025-04-06</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB and Vagrancy</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-06</suggestion-date><issue>Brief description - Gants Hill Underground station serves as the main transport hub in Barkingside, that serves hundreds members of Public due to its direct link into Central London. Gants Hill Underground is also situated at a busy roundabout junction, that correspondingly attracts vagrancy, begging and general ASB at the traffic lights and subway underpasses.
</issue><issue-date>2025-04-06</issue-date><action>Actions

SPECIFIC: To reduce the number of rough sleepers that beg at public places at Gants Hill and the subway underpasses. General ASB creates a detrimental impact to the quality of life on the ward especially to the local community and residents, regarding feelings of their safety in the area especially during the night. 

MEASURABLE:  This can be measured on reporting incidents to Police and feedback during the community events, drop in surgery, community contact session at Gants hill Library.

ACHIEVABLE: The persistent usage of Dispersal orders under section 35-39 of Anti-Social Behaviour and Crime and Policing Act 2014.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-22</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY:

To reduce knife-enabled watch robberies in the streets surrounding Brompton Road and Sloane Street.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police.

This can be achieved by operations targeting robbery hotspot areas, high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening - crime prevention advice and engagement via social media.

This issue has historically been prevalent across AW BCU, and previous years have seen the number of offences rising in the warmer summer months, when victim's watches are more likely to be visible. A number of these offences have received viral coverage on social media, and this type of crime continues to be a matter of concern for Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).
</issue><issue-date>2025-04-22</issue-date><action>Proactive and plain clothes operations have been carried out across the AW BCU involving officers from specialist police units, which have resulted in the arrest of a number of suspects for watch robbery offences.

Officers have also been running regular crime prevention stands, such as the 'Look up, look out' campaign.</action><action-date>2025-04-22</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-22</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce Theft From Motor Vehicle offences in Hans Place, Egerton Gardens and Lowndes Square.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, plain-clothes deployments in conjunction with pursuit-trained units, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through crime prevention advice via social media/leaflet drops and working with RBKandC Council to install signage/CCTV on affected streets.

The number of these type of offences has previously peaked over the winter months, leading up to and following on from Christmas. Crime figures show that levels of this type of crime had reduced on the ward by around 50% since Winter 2023, however it is still one of the most prevalent offences on the ward, and recently in February and March 2025 there was a marked increase in these crimes. This concern is shared by Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).</issue><issue-date>2025-04-22</issue-date><action>Proactive patrols carried out over the past 12 months as part of Op LUBBOCHI, and more recently intelligence-led patrols linked to a prolific suspect for these offences, who was arrested in March.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through effective use of cocooning visits, crime prevention advice via social media and face-to-face community engagement events.

This number of these type of offences has previously risen over the summer months, when some homes are unoccupied with people away on holiday, and windows left open due to warmer weather. Historically this type of crime also tends to increase in the months leading up to Christmas.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).

This also leads to rough sleeping on front door steps and damage to property. In response to this officers and partner agencies will perform a number of targeted patrols in and around the Town Centre at peak times
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-04</issue-date><action>Officer Uplift for Brixton Windrush: We’ve recently welcomed two new members of our team, meaning that we’ve now got 3 x PCs and 3 x PCSOs. On their shift days, this enables to the officers to divide and patrol in more areas to increase visibility. 

Daily Patrols/CPWs: 
When on shift, the Brixton Windrush Officers are conducting daily patrols in and around the Ward primarily focusing on the Town Centre as that’s where our highest concentration of issues occur. Whilst out on patrol, officers are engaging with repeat offenders and issuing CPWs and CPNs to those who require enforcement. 

Days Of Action: 
The Team take part in monthly muti-agency Days of Action in ASB Hotspots across the Ward. 

Tackling the Handling of Stolen Goods:  
Officers visited 102 shops in the Town Centre to hand deliver letters and warn businesses about the dangers of handling stolen goods. We did this because we recognise that shoplifting is often a bi-product of drug use and we’re hoping to reduce the demand for stolen goods and make it harder for offenders to offload stolen goods. </action><action-date>2025-01-04</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) </suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-04</suggestion-date><issue>As ever this remains a priority and is a specific BCU priority.

Mapesbury and Cricklewood SNT will continue to show uniform patrols along Cricklewood Broadway and Chichele Road as this is the hotspot for violence on the streets. Embedded with this is Operation Terminos focusing on Violence, however Operation Terminos 2.0 will commence in May to focus on driving down violence further. The SNT have been working closely with Barnet Cricklewood SNT to provide uniformed patrols. Violence in the area has decreased however this will still be a main focus to show police presence and try to identify suspects through CCTV footage.

Burglary on the ward is decreasing. Compared to this time last year burglaries are down. We are constantly identifying burglars and disrupting there activity to prevent further offences and the damage it has on victims lives. We continue to visit those victims who have been burgled to provide reassurance and to seize any cctv footage at an early stage of the investigation so that if the suspect is identified by officers they are apprehended at the earliest opportunity. With this we try to attach criminal behaviour orders or community protection warnings/notices against the suspects identified in order for them to stop this criminal behaviour as it has a significant impact on the victims.

Anti-social behaviour is an issue across London. There are some hotspot areas, which the SNT are aware of where people loiter and use drugs. Working closely with the local authority enables them to challenge these individuals and to provide them with strong words of advice. If there anti-social behaviour continues, they will be receive a formal warning. The team also conduct days of actions with the local authority. Any continued anti-social behaviour issues the team will look at taking action to known individuals that keep causing problems, this could be from issuing community protection warnings, community protection notices and criminal behaviour orders. Drug use is the main concern where it is suspected that drug users commit crime in order to fund their drug habit. We are working closely with services that can support drug users so that they can receive the necessary help. 
</issue><issue-date>2025-03-27</issue-date><action>Work with local authority and charities such as St Mungo's to help house the drug users and provide any safeguarding if necessary.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-07</suggestion-date><issue>‘VehicleMania’, a ward-exclusive campaign incorporating both theft of and theft from vehicle crime will main event the team’s preventative efforts this spring. Owners of the most at-risk vehicles will be visited and encouraged to make use of independent security measures, including steering wheel locks, while checks will be conducted to ensure items of potential value are not left on display inside vehicles to help remove opportunities for theft. The team’s social media platforms will also be used to further remind residents and visitors to the ward of the best ways to keep their vehicles safe and secure.</issue><issue-date>2025-04-07</issue-date><action>The ’Road to VehicleMania’ began on March 15th, with 15 vehicle owners spoken to about steering wheel locks, wheel clamps and collapsible bollards. In recent years, the types of vehicle being reported stolen have become less predictable so everything from the Toyota to the Kia were subject of these visits. Meanwhile, the opening week of April saw 448 vehicles checked in the Rush Green area, resulting in 6 incidents of items of potential value being found on display, ranging from cash to golf clubs.

VehicleMania aims to be the team’s biggest vehicle crime-related initiative in its 18-year history.

Strategies for combating vehicle theft will include visiting residents hyperlocal to incidents and those who own same-type vehicles to those being targeted. A similar approach was taken between 2019-2021, which saw 478 visits across the ward, with 87 Ford Fiesta, 46 BMW and 20 Range Rover owners among those provided advice. A methodical measure will also be used to remove opportunities for theft from vehicle offences, including a ‘car-by-car’ approach to identify  items of potential value left on display. A day in April this year saw 246 vehicles checked, while July 2020 recorded 470 checks in a single day, including 316 on Parish Fields. On the latter occasion, 11 items of potential value were noted and brought to the attention of the owners. </issue><issue-date>2025-04-07</issue-date><action>Eastbrook and Rush Green ward continues to be a safe place to live and visit, with violent incidents in public places among the borough’s lowest. The team have continued to provide a precautionary presence around Rush Green’s Barking and Dagenham College, a potential hotspot for robbery given the high number of young people attending the venue, along with coverage of open spaces, with a recent patrol in March taking in 2.5 miles of the Eastbrookend Country Park and surrounding area. Early evening foot patrols remain a staple of the SNT’s efforts to provide reassurance for those heading home to the ward after work, which has included Footpath 155, a cut-through between Rush Green Road and Gorseway often used by residents.</action><action-date>2025-04-07</action-date></priority></priorities>

Most recently one of the males arrested is now currently in prison after an arrest by the team, another was arrested when found with class A drugs and a third was arrested for weapons offensives.
The team is also utilising CBOs, CPNS and ASB warning notices to disrupt these gang nominal by restricting which locations they can visit and who they can associate with, which so far is proving to be effective. The team has noted the robberies in North Feltham appear to be targeting electric bikes and e-scooters, with suspects usually wearing balaclavas and working in groups. The team will increase patrols near to Feltham Train Station and Feltham Park.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-03</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and burglary
To reduce incidents of Robbery and burglary in the Earl’s Court area.
Measurable: the incidences of robbery and burglary can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, and ASB reports relating to robbery and attempted robbery.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by the continuation of high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, vehicle patrols, variation of shifts to include late and night shifts, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening. We also provide crime prevention advice and engagement via social media. Earl’s Court SNT officers regularly change their shifts to combat robbery and burglary, and conduct stop and search where grounds exist.

Measurable: this can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, intelligence reports, and ASB reports relating to drugs, as well as the anecdotal evidence seen by officers, WP members and local residents.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by a combination of high-visibility patrols within the highlighted area, joint working with RBKC wardens officers, robust enforcement of PSPO legislation and effective use of CPW/CPN to  offenders. Earl’s Court officers have been proactive in obtaining two very successful warrants recently, recovering approx. £30,000 of drugs. Drug users have reported that the area is currently ‘too hot’ for drugs and they are going elsewhere. Local drug users are regularly stopped and searched, leading to a number of arrests and community resolutions. The drug hotspots in Earls Court are around Nevern Square, Nevern Place, Trebovir Road and Templeton Place. These areas are patrolled when officers are on duty.

This priority is aimed at reducing the street robberies in and around the Winstanley Estate area. In particular, any streets or public greens such as York Gardens which serve as a thoroughfare for commuters egressing from Clapham Junction who may find themselves as victims of personal robbery, in particular during the hours of darkness later in the year.
Ongoing patrols where our late turn shifts allow serve as a good point to deal with this.
In addition, utilising support from other resources and teams such as the new Neighbourhood Tasking Team, and the Territorial Support Group will assist us in dealing with such issues</issue><issue-date>2024-11-29</issue-date><action>Research of intelligence system to identify locations for patrols and potential offenders.

This is not bespoke to one particular area of our ward, instead it is found to exist in multiple areas across Latchmere.
Will will map out each crime using Met Insights / PlanWeb, and using this data, we will be able to work out hotspots and as such, co-ordinate patrols effectively.
When at each hotspot, and circumstance permitting, good use of Stop and Search, and where applicable, good use of the information sharing agreement with the council may assist in dealing with those most troublesome.
ASB comes in many form - such as, noise disturbances from addresses engaged in drug dealing, loitering in and around these areas thus putting neighbours in fear of harm, urination / defecation in stairwells and other public access areas of buildings, graffiti. The list is non exhaustive.
Where we identify addresses that are causing ASB issues and where drugs are the nucleus, we can use ASB powers to good use - such as Closure Orders under Section 80 of the ASB Act of 2014.</issue><issue-date>2024-11-29</issue-date><action>High Visibility patrols to the locations identified to deter those committing Anti-Social Behaviour.

SPECIFIC: Reduce the fear of assaults by members of the public in public places across Barkingside. To also gain public confidence in local Policing. 

MEASURABLE: Success can be measured by the declination of number of reported incidents to Police and positive feedback during community events and engagements with members of the community. This enables Police to seek community opinions, concerns and queries regarding the hotspot areas mentioned in the latter.

ACHIEVABLE: Ensure members of the community feel safe and can safely use the locations. Focus is on working with the community including other agencies such as TFL and Redbridge Enforcement, carry out high Vis and plain clothes patrols, VAWG walk and talks, community contact session and stalls set up in busy areas. 
RELEVANT: Ensure members of the community can safely use the public locations and the public subway. 

TIMELY: The period between ward panel meetings will be used to monitor the success of this problem-solving process. Resources will also be taken into consideration, Review to take place prior to ward panel meetings which are held 4 times per year. Surveys are also sent out to ward residents to obtain opinions or concerns that are used to monitor success rates of neighbourhood policing.

We held VAWG engagement events such as International Women’s Day Community engagement and a Walk and Talk in Harrow Town Centre. Most recently a VAWG day of action saw many reources brought in to the town centre showcasing many of the tools available to Police to tackle such offences. Several individuals were arrested for a variety of offences including one around unlawful sexual activity. The team were also out and about offering advice around keeping yourself safe particularly as the darker nights are drawing in.

There has been an increase on the number of reports of Thefts from the Person at various business premises in Harrow Town Centre.
Greenhill SNT will work in partnership with BID Team, the local retailers and Shopping Centre security to prevent and deter such incidents and make the area safer for the local community.
</issue><issue-date>2024-12-14</issue-date><action>Greenhill SNT has increased our patrols in the area, during Op Willamar and during Op Nightingale. High visibility patrols are being conducted at business premises that are mostly affected by this type of crime. We have had meetings with the management of businesses and banks in the town centre during Operation Retail, discussing the increasing crime trend and ways to deter and prevent such incidents from occurring and make the area safer for the local community. With Christmas looming the team are targeting shoplifters and begging across the town with an uplift in officers both plain clothed and uniform. This has already seen several excellent results with arrests on prolific robbers, career beggars and anti-social behaviour. The team want to see people coming in to the town enjoying their shopping experiences with friends and family and to not be hindered by those intent on committing crime.</action><action-date>2024-12-14</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>E Scooter and Bikes committing theft and robbery</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-12-14</suggestion-date><issue>To tackle those using the town centre to commit E scooter and bike Thefts.</issue><issue-date>2024-12-14</issue-date><action>Following the ward panel meeting earlier this year this will be a priority for the Greenhill team. Officers are using motor cycles, plain clothed patrols to tackle those coming into the town to commit robberies and theft and this approach has already seen one prolific robber taken off the street found in possession of drugs and an offensive weapon. This will not be tolerated and with the run up to Christmas it is expected that there will be more of these crime types prevalent in the town. The team will be out reminding those on best practise to keep themselves and their property safe. There will be several community events in and around the town hosted by the team so please do keep a look out.</action><action-date>2024-12-14</action-date></priority></priorities>

2nd ward panel priority that was set is  as shoplifting and ASB . Hammersmith Broadway Ward is predominately business orientated and not so much residential. There are a number of retailers that have voiced their concerns via the local partners BID and SBN and that are requesting the local SNT assistance in focusing in retain crime and ASB. 
</issue><issue-date>2024-11-28</issue-date><action>Ways we can achieve this is to continue to conduct business premises visits and engagements in order to give out crime prevention. We will also work alongside other partners (BID, SBN, LA-LET).  In relation to shoplifting, this goes hand in hand with ASB, once CPN's have started to make a difference and geographical bans are put in place with the common faces within the ward we should see a reduction in shoplifting </action><action-date>2024-11-28</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs and ASB </suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-11-28</suggestion-date><issue>
Within the ASB aspect , the begging and other low level petty crime can be included and the most prolific location is King Street. This can be done with a multi-agency approach linking in with council and BID/SBN, LET teams to share information. Can be measured through number of CPNs/warnings given out as well as general perceptions of area, again a date will be set to review this.

The Hounslow Central and East wards include vicinities around the Hounslow Town Centre and include areas of high footfall throughout the day and night. There are a vast number of shops, restaurants, and transport networks, and we see a big presence of delivery riders on both cycles and mopeds. 
Pedal Bicycles (Safety) Regulations 2010 - Bicycles must be sold with a bell, though bells do not have to be fitted to a bike thereafter. We want to encourage the installation and utilisation of bells.
Unless there are cycle lanes which you would prefer to use, cyclists should always use the roads. This is because they are a lot faster than pedestrians, which makes them a hazard to them.

To achieve this, we aim to decrease drug and alcohol use and drug dealing (including through use of cars, mopeds, e-scooters, and bicycles in an around all public parks and recreational grounds.

These patrols have increased and the results are reflective of this. In one park alone in a single day, 3 cannabis detections were made within the space of a few hours. These patrols will continue, with the aim of identifying the offenders, and letting them know that Kenton open spaces are not the places from criminal and anti-social activity. 
2 – Kenton will be increasing their surgeries and community contact sessions being held in parks and open spaces, allowing residence to attend and speak with their local bobbies. 
3 – Kenton SNT have assisted the ward panel chair to achieve a suitable outcome, of the demolition of Lidding Road garages, a hotspot for anti-social and illegal activity, spilling out into the Woodcock Park open space.  
4 – Kenton and Preston have made a number of changes to their shifts to be available and present during times where anti-social and illegal activity is known to peak during twilight hours. 
5 – We will be holding at least once a month a dedicated VAWG contact session, where we will encourage people to come forward with concerns or questions and be offering advice where possible.

This includes dangerous vehicle driving in private carparks, the use of vehicle on foot paths and through pedestrian gates, and the general use of vehicles in crime, including drug dealing, robberies and burglaries. </issue><issue-date>2024-10-13</issue-date><action>1 – Kenton SNT take a zero tolerance approach to the anti social use of vehicles. This is being tackled by the use of anti-social vehicle warnings being issued to vehicles and drivers based of evidence provided to the police from residents and business owners. These warnings, if breached may result in the seizure of the vehicle, incurring release fee’s and penalties. All residents are encouraged to submit any evidence of anti-social vehicle use to Kenton SNT so these or similar actions can be taken.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-03</suggestion-date><issue>Robberies and Violence Against Women and Girls 
Due to our recent CAP meeting VAWG/Robbery has been brought up as a priority for the ward due to VAWG related incidents increasing such as exposures and robbery.  Officers will aim to find the affected areas and target them effectively by providing High Visibility patrols an crime prevention literature. Officers will work towards reducing Violence Against Women And Girls by focusing patrols in areas where women/girls feel most vulnerable. There will be contact points available for members of the public to walk and talk with officers. 
Priorities set at ward panel meeting on 08/02/2025.
</issue><issue-date>2025-04-03</issue-date><action>Over the Last month, officers have conducted targeted patrols in REDWALD ROAD and HOMERTON ROAD that as shown through intelligence have higher robbery rates.  Alongside patrols officers are actively stopping members of the public and providing crime prevention advice, specifically telling members of the public to put their phone away at bus stops. 

In Regards, to the low coverage when it comes to CCTV and little to nothing lighting on HACKNEY MARSHES, Officers are now working closely with hackney council, canal river trust and other agencies to combat the crimes that are happening in the Hackney Marshes. Over the last month there has been an Environmental Audit Meeting in the Marshes that allowed police and other agencies to discuss what the problem is and how to work towards solving it. 

The meeting led to hedges being trimmed down and clearing out some of the areas under the bridges, which will act as a deterrent due to the area being more open rather than hidden. There is a potential for bringing in solar powered lights however due to an endangered species of bats this may not be possible.

Priorities set at ward panel meeting on 08/02/2025.</issue><issue-date>2025-04-03</issue-date><action>The Police Neighbourhood Team has been actively engaged in combatting motor vehicle crime within the community. This is being tackled  through increased patrols and checking vehicles that seem to be abandoned or match the description of a stolen vehicle. Officers are providing high visibility patrols to deter and prevent vehicle crime, while also speaking to members of the public on how to avoid broken windows by not leaving any items in the vehicle or parking the vehicle in an area with light and high foot flow to deter individuals from targeting that vehicle. Recently, Officers have partnered with the Hackney vehicle nuisance team to conduct patrols over the ward for reassurance and prevention, This has led to multiple PCN's being given.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-02-27</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERIES
S. To reduce the amount of robberies on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of robberies happen near to Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road. This is due to residents/non-residents attending the area and visiting local bars and restaurant’s. Members of public are then normally targeted walking home from venues in off streets from the main roads.

A. Though Plain Cloths operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. A mobile CCTV camera has been requested from the council and placed on the junction of Old Brompton Road and Drayton Gardens to tackle the issue. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Creswell Place and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. Robberies appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. 

T. To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting.

Statistic’s are showing a slight rise in high value residential Burglaries, which are being targeted. Entrance through windows is common place by force using blunt tools....and using scaffolding to access neighbours..
 ***Garage burglaries have shown an increase***
SMART:-
Specific  –  Prevent and Reduce Cycle and vehicle ASB on the whole ward but specifically near Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and Edith Grove.
Measurable – Measure through, statistic crime reports, trend mapping and calls to police (Crimes recorded).
Achievable – Attained through preventative high visibility patrols in key areas along with operations.
Relevant – Due to the personal nature of the crime this is a top ward priority. 
Timely – This will be measured and reviewed at the next ward panel meeting (every three months)</issue><issue-date>2025-02-27</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2025-02-27</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Motor Vehicle crime</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-02-27</suggestion-date><issue>S: Reduce the amount of MV Crime, but numbers are currently High.

There have been no reported vehicle ASB at this venue for the last 7 weekends.

The longest period since the start of 2024 was 3 weeks.

This suggests that the partnership work between North Acton safer neighbourhoods team, ASDA and the Met police Safer Roads Team has delivered for the local community.

We continue to monitor the situation.

Initially we have worked at creating a positive working relationship with ASDA, both at store level and at corporate level.

The response from ASDA has been extremely positive resulting in them committing resources to design out the issue at this location but also assisting the Met with enforcement action.

The first phase of work was completed by ASDA on 15/12/24 when they added speed humps to the roundabout.

This denied the use of the roundabout for the vast majority of those attending for this purpose. As a result attendance shift from 9:30pm on wards to later after 11pm. This de-conflicted the groups with legitimate users, with the group waiting until customers had left to enable them to use the main body of the car park.

ASDA have confirmed that the second phase of work are due in the next fortnight, this will see a permanent redesign of the road about, along with barriers to prevent access to car park out of hours, which we hope will further deny the group use of the main car park after hours.

Further investment by ASDA has enabled the safer roads team to take enforcement action against those attending. This helps both with the issue here in Park Royal, but also pan London and even nationally.

The safer roads team working with ASDA review all evidence from any car meets and follow up with the relevant enforcement.

As of 15/02/2025

3 INCIDENTS IN TOTAL REPORTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2025 

S59 warning = 243
Vehicles to be seized =18
Notice of intended prosecution = 9
Attendance warning letters = 78
Vehicles seized = 4
Traffic offence reports = 2

We continue to work with ASDA and the safer roads team to review progress and impact.

In addition to working locally, we have brought in the ward team covering Dagenham, as well as other areas within the West Area, and are in the process of engaging with Thames Valley Police.

One such location is the area surrounding the junction of Bollo Bridge Road with Strafford Road.

Our response is to adopt hotspot policing tactics over the next 3 months to deter violence, anti-social behaviour and other forms of criminality.

We will use crime/ASB reporting data to target our patrols at peak times.

We will provide an update to the panel of the number, frequency and duration of patrols supported by mapping data.</issue><issue-date>2025-02-12</issue-date><action>Priority details to be circulated to ward panel and local community via relevant contacts and communication platforms.</action><action-date>2025-02-12</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Parcel Theft</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-02-12</suggestion-date><issue>Upon reviewing the crime data supplied by police, an area was highlighted as experiencing a higher levels of parcel theft from communal areas of blocks (burglary).

The panel therefore decided the team should focus patrols in this area for the next 3 months, and where possible work partners to find a long term solution.

The treatment area will be Enfield Road, Streamdale Road, Hanbury Road, Osbourne Road and Whelan Road.

The approach will be hotspot policing tactics, these were very effective when used in a different area of South Acton suffering similar issues.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-11-13</suggestion-date><issue>1 Robbery
The local team will prioritise robberies following a few offences being recorded over the previous quarter. 
All allegations of robbery within the ward will be attended, local enquiries with possible witnesses and CCTV will be pursued to assist in the investigation
Where possible, contact will be maintained with victims to ensure they are supported through the process
Any suspects will be targeted through ‘Achilles Heel’ tactics for other offences in order to deter these offenders.
Patrols will be completed in areas identified at high risk where possible to deter offenders
Stop and search will be used where intelligence supports action to detect people carrying weapons and stolen property
The team will engage with the Priority Crime Unit to support their investigations where possible
The success of the work will be based on the number of offences recorded between 6/03/2024 and 5/6/2024
These actions are achievable with prioritisation, however some will require the assistance of other teams and units
This is relevant due to the increased number of offences and the nature of the offence
The priority will be reviewed on 5th June 2024 at the next ward panel meeting
</issue><issue-date>2024-11-13</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-11-13</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drug Dealing</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-11-13</suggestion-date><issue>The local team will focus on drug use and supply, specifically targeting to disrupt users and supply of drugs. This will be achieved through concentration of Hot spot areas identified to us around Rayners Lane Estate, Newton Farm Ecology Park and the surrounding streets. Drugs users found in possession of drugs paraphernalia but not substance will be issued with Community Protection Notice Warnings (CPNW’s) in order to prohibit anti-social behaviour. Any breaches will be dealt with robustly.
Premises with closure orders will be monitored to ensure that they no longer attract drug users and keep the users visible on the streets to allow them to be dealt with by CPNW.
A Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) will be considered in any conviction following breaches of CPN’s to give long term solutions
Drug users are believed to be influencing a spike in theft from motor vehicle offences and motor vehicle interference offences, this also fuels violent crime through the supply of drugs and disputes over territory around supply areas.
This will be measured as quantifiable results for searches of persons, premises and vehicles for drugs, CPNW’s issued and breaches of closures orders.
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

This covers a wide range of issues including tipping, littering, spitting, breaches of the public space protection order and noise issues.
The local ward team will triage allegations of ASB in the community which are reported to police. The team will work with Kingdom Security and ensure coverage of the ward when the ward team are not on duty is maximised using these other resources to address these concerns. Persons identified as causing ASB will be engaged with and where the evidence supports, issued with prohibitions under community protection legislation to address these behaviours. The police will continue to refer incidents of tipping to the local authority and assist where necessary in progressing their investigations into these offences.
This will be measured by collating the number of ASB allegations which are made to police and the relevant interventions that are introduced by police.
The ward team are actively involved in reducing ASB as part of our core duties and therefore with some intensification, this should be achievable
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

4 – A closure order has been put in place and has been running for nearly 3 months at the time of this update. Since the closure has been in place complaints from residents have drastically decreased and a recent visit has suggested that residents are happy with the closure and the positive effect it has had.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-05</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY – Violence Related Priority

Ward Priority 1 - Violence 
This is the MPS priority set in the ward panel.
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on a greater awareness of Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG).
The police will specifically conduct proactive engagement with the relevant demographics and other demographics who wish to highlight issues. A minimum of two events will be held within the ward and one of these will operate in the vicinity of Rayners Lane Tube Station.
The team will gather relevant information about where people feel unsafe and also address the perception of crime. A comprehensive intelligence and information picture will be developed over the period which will be presented to the ward panel and will be analysed to establish if there are available interventions
This process is intended to better understand the problem, previous interactions of this nature have been well received and well attended and therefore this should be achievable
This links to violence and the fear of violence, it is therefore relevant
This engagement will commence for three months and should be sufficient time to develop an understanding of local issues
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-05</issue-date><action>Rayners Lane SNT PC's and PCSO have conducted regular mobile and foot patrols across the ward during various times of the day. We have completed daily weapons sweeps at various locations especially at hot spots, such as service roads on ALEXANDRA AVENUE and concealed staircases.
 
Operation GOODRICH: Local ward officers have been patrolling RAYNERS LANE STATION to engage with girls and women to make them aware about the VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) and issue literature, give advice and encourage women and girls to report any unsafe streets on STREET SAFE.
</action><action-date>2025-01-05</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 2 - Substance Abuse</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-05</suggestion-date><issue>The SNT will target offenders abusing substances in the ward, utilising Achilles heels tactics to disrupt and deter offending, including use of the Public Space Protection Order.
Where intelligence is received about supply or use, the team will actively use all powers available to disrupt these offenders and obtain evidence of these offences.
Officers will continue to engage with the community to identify areas where these issues are prevalent, including engaging with local businesses and enforcing licence conditions for the sale of alcohol.

The SNT will record encounters and present these results to the ward panel 

Officers will be present in the community and come across issues for substance abuse, paying specific attention to these problems will make this goal achievable.

This has been sighted as an issue on the survey and by the ward panel and therefore it is relevant

This priority has been set for 3 months and will be reviewed at the next Ward panel meeting on 04/05/2024
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-05</issue-date><action>Patrols in area known for the most drug use, such as, Alexander Avenue and Rayner Lane and Community Protection Warnings and Community Protection Notices will be issued to nominals known to police for drug. 
Research and intelligence gathering underway for consideration of targeted individuals and addresses for enforcement action.  High visibility Patrols taken place in locations where the majority of incidents take place.  Local contact with residents and local shop keepers to alleviate their concerns. 

Street briefings across roads where issues have occurred to notify public of police action and for intelligence gathering.  
</action><action-date>2025-01-05</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 3 - Burglary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-05</suggestion-date><issue>This priority is set by the ward panel from 20/01/2024 until 04/05/2024
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on the prevention and detection of burglaries.
The police will specifically identify all allegations of burglary within the ward, including both residential and non-residential burglaries. The team will complete local enquiries and complete CCTV trawls in order to identify suspect leads and contribute towards investigations of these offences.
The team will identify the most prolific offenders and use Achilles heels tactics with these individuals to remove their opportunity to commit these offences.
The team will proactively engage and support the priority crime unit to assist with their investigations and help to develop linked series of offences where there are opportunities to do so.
The team will actively promote crime prevention advice for specified roads within the ward that are a greater risk of Asian Gold thefts which are known to increase at this time of year.
The proactive operation will be led by the team targeting offenders, crime prevention is a within the capacity of the team to deliver and therefore this is achievable
The panel have elected this priority, this has been corroborated by the ward panel survey and it is relevant to the local area.
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-05</issue-date><action>The team have attended and completed follow up visits to all victims of burglary who reside within the ward. The officers have been completing CCTV trawls and gathering intelligence to determine offending patters and similar methods to maximise the quality of investigations.

Officers have been using powers to search suspects for stolen property, and for articles going equipped to steal within the ward.

ASB is low in the area and when it does occur, it is often attributed to the street population around the Lillington and Longmore estate and around Victoria train Station. Last quarter this had spread to adjacent areas but concentrated patrols appears to have reduced this. However reports of drug taking in private gardens and cellar areas still raises it head. Begging, drug taking, drug paraphernalia, rubbish being left are all symptoms of the street population and will be targeted by local officers. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. We will be receiving support from our Local Policing teams such as The Violence Suppression unit and Gangs Unit, who can add extra numbers and skills to have an impact on resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2025-04-24</issue-date><action>Heightened patrols will take place at targeted times and locations in order to target the issue. The use of community protection notices will continue, targeting those engaging in anti-social behaviour. We will work alongside our partners, including the VBID, Homeless charities and above all, Hopkinson House. Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any signs of potential drug dealing, no matter how small it may seem. If any community members would also like to be part of a walk-along patrol to discuss this issue, please use the contact forms on this site. Local officers  will continue to work with  both internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London and other police forces such as the City of London Police and British Transport Police to conduct joint operations focusing on areas known as drug hotspots and attempting to disrupt county lines. Drug Dealers will also continue to be our prime target.</action><action-date>2025-04-24</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Road Related ASB</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-24</suggestion-date><issue>Pimlico Noth Ward is geographically located where there is  a high volume of Vehicle and Pedestrian traffic in amongst key transport hubs.

Levels of violent offences are low in Sydenham particularly outside of domestic settings.
Sydenham has a number of bail and probation addresses where offenders are housed.
SNT officers will target the enforcement of bail conditions, recalls to prison, and breach of licences by violent offenders and reduce the number of wanted violent offenders on the ward.
This will be reviewed on 16/04/2025

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-04-30</suggestion-date><issue>The prevention of motor vehicle crime remains a significant focus due to ongoing reports of theft from vehicles and the theft of high-value keyless entry vehicles. The ward panel has agreed that this issue warrants continued attention and resources.</issue><issue-date>2025-04-30</issue-date><action>Hotspot Monitoring The team will consistently monitor crime reports related to motor vehicle incidents, focusing on identified hotspot areas to implement targeted patrols.
 
Both high-visibility and plainclothes officers will patrol areas known for motor vehicle crime, particularly during times when such crimes are most likely to occur.
 
Officers will personally contact victims of motor vehicle crime to offer relevant crime prevention advice, ensuring they feel supported and informed. This outreach will also provide valuable insights into community concerns and experiences.
 
The team will enhance awareness efforts by utilising the ward's Twitter account, monthly newsletter, and community events to share crime prevention tips related to vehicle security and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
 
Overall, these strategies aim to create a safer environment in Southgate by engaging with the community, fostering trust, and ensuring a proactive police presence to deter crime effectively.

Officers have been patrolling the above areas regularly to monitor the ASB issues.
We will continue to patrol the location to reduce ASB by giving out ASB warnings, Community Protection Notice (CPNs) stops and searches and arrest if necessary. 

</issue><issue-date>2025-04-30</issue-date><action>Heightened patrols have taken place, resulting in community interactions and CPN’s being issued to people causing ASB. Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any signs of potential drug dealing, ASB, etc., no matter how small it may seem. If any community members would also like to be part of a walk-along patrol to discuss this issue, please use the contact forms on this site.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-30</suggestion-date><issue>Shoplifting offences account for the largest proportion of all crime recorded on the ward. The Nugent Retail Park in SMC is known as a hotpot for shoplifting offences and is a significant crime generator. With a large number of retail outlets, the area is frequented by prolific, priority offenders, known to police to be drug dependent who often offend to fund their addiction. Items stolen include cosmetics, meat, alcohol and certain medium to high value clothing. The area is also known for persons approaching shoppers, asking for money in the street, or when standing at cashpoints. They can be verbally aggressive with members of the public who decline to give them money. These crimes and ASB place additional demand on local policing and discourages members of the public from shopping at the location, which in turn has a negative effect upon trade. </issue><issue-date>2024-10-30</issue-date><action>Regular uniformed patrols are carried out along with targeted plain clothes tasking.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-17</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery
 
Priority
 
The team will maintain a strong focus on combating robbery incidents around Southgate Tube station Chase Side , and around Southgate College as discussed and agreed upon with the ward panel. The presence of both high-visibility and plainclothes officers has already proven effective in deterring potential suspects and reducing incidents. The ward panel has emphasised the necessity of sustaining officer presence to prevent any resurgence in crime rates.
 
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-17</issue-date><action>Ongoing Action 
Officers will conduct thorough reviews of overnight crimes within the ward to identify emerging trends. This data will inform ward officers and assists in establishing connections between any related cases and hotspot crime areas .
 
The team will engage in both uniformed and plainclothes proactive patrols in identified hotspot areas to deter criminal activity. These patrols will be strategically timed to maximise visibility and impact.
 
Relevant crime prevention advice will be disseminated through the ward’s Twitter account and monthly newsletter. Additionally, officers will conduct crime prevention visits to engage with residents directly and provide tailored advice.
 
Regular meetings with the ward panel will ensure that community concerns are addressed, and feedback is incorporated into ongoing strategies.

</action><action-date>2025-01-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Motor Vehicle Crime</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-17</suggestion-date><issue>Motor Vehicle Crime
 
Priority
 
The prevention of motor vehicle crime remains a significant focus due to ongoing reports of theft from vehicles and the theft of high-value keyless entry vehicles. The ward panel has agreed that this issue warrants continued attention and resources.

</issue><issue-date>2025-01-17</issue-date><action>The team will enhance awareness efforts by utilising the ward's Twitter account, monthly newsletter, and community events to share crime prevention tips related to vehicle security and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
 
Overall, these strategies aim to create a safer environment in Southgate by engaging with the community, fostering trust, and ensuring a proactive police presence to deter crime effectively.
</action><action-date>2025-01-17</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Burgary</suggestion><suggestion-date>2025-01-17</suggestion-date><issue>Priority
Burglary has now become the ward's primary concern, particularly with the onset of longer dark  nights, which have correlated with a slight rise  in burglary incidents. The ward panel recognises the need for a proactive approach to address this issue promptly.
</issue><issue-date>2025-01-17</issue-date><action>Ongoing Action 
 
The team will analyse overnight crime reports to identify trends and potential series of linked burglaries. This information will be compiled into intelligence reports to better inform patrol strategies.
 
Similar to the approach taken with robbery, the team will distribute relevant crime prevention advice through the ward’s social media platforms, monthly newsletter, and directly during community engagement events.
 
Officers will increase their visibility in residential areas, particularly during peak hours for burglaries, to deter potential offenders. Shifts will be changed to meet the peak hours 
 
Organise home visits to residents at risk to educate on home security measures and encourage them to report suspicious activity, fostering a proactive community approach to crime prevention.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-12-12</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has been identified as a repeat area for robbery occurring in the West End. Soho is a small area relative to other wards in the area, it has a bustling night time economy which many thousands of people come to, primarily over the weekends. Robbery in Soho is mainly fuelled by the night time economy. Intoxicated patrons leaving bars, clubs, and pubs become targets for groups and individuals intent on stealing their personal property. It is a concern of Soho residents and visitors alike, as robbery is a highly invasive and distressing crime to become victim of. The Met has tasked pan-London units to patrol in Soho to combat these violent offences. The West End Proactive Partnership Team is the West End’s dedicated team of officers that are out on foot patrol covering the night time economy. They continue to actively target robbery suspects.</issue><issue-date>2024-12-12</issue-date><action>Proactive teams from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group have already been conducting targeted patrols around Soho. This has seen numerous arrests for robbery and related offences, and disrupting those suspected of being involved in violent offences. Officers in Soho will continue to proactively identify offenders and stop robberies from occurring. Using evidence based approaches, targeting specific roads where the majority of offences are known to occur. High visibility patrols will continue to provide reassurance to members of the public, and provide both reactive and proactive elements in combating robbery, so officers are able to quickly attend calls in Soho. Local Ward officers will be hosting crime prevention stalls, and engagement events in busy areas of Soho which anyone is welcome to attend.</action><action-date>2024-12-12</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-12-12</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has seen sporadic but concentrated issues surrounding the blatant use of drugs on the streets. Several areas in Soho have repeatedly had issues with drug users congregating in areas with low foot traffic, doorways and poorly lit areas. Officers are aware and engaging with drug users, who the majority of are vulnerable or living on the streets. Officers have worked alongside the council and outreach services in order to take a longer term non-enforcement action, which in the long run will produce better more time efficient results as opposed to constantly arresting offenders. Some users/offenders are not engaging well with the diversion and assistance routes offered to them so enforcement action will be taken.</issue><issue-date>2024-12-12</issue-date><action>Officers will continue to carry out proactive targeted patrols to problem areas at the times of day identified by residents. Officers to better utilise their stop and search powers coupled with solid information and intelligence submitted by residents and victims of Anti-Social Behaviour. Officers will also continue to make referrals to outreach services to those willing to engage. Officers will be issuing CPWs, CPN,s and eventually CBOs to prolific offenders that cause anti-social behaviour through the use of drugs. For residents, please submit information reports through official Met reporting channels as this information will get filtered to us, and we will use this information to proactively target anti-social behaviour hotspots.

This would give Police and Council additional powers to deal with nuisance vehicles. There is a general upgrade to CCTV cameras around the Ward that can help to identify offending vehicles and drivers. 

Police and Council urge residents and buisness to report vehicle based ASB to the Councils 'Report it' service or on the Met Police website.</action><action-date>2024-12-12</action-date></priority></priorities>

In line with MET policy. Reducing Robberies along Chamberlayne Road, Kensal Rise station and Purves Road.

It had been reported that robberies were occurring along Chamberlayne Road mostly between the hours of 1500 -1700 hrs Monday to Friday and that the victims are of school age.
School children like to have the latest mobile phones or trainers for example which therefore makes them an easy target. Also things such as not being aware to keep personal items out of sight when walking from school (air pods, watches, jewellery)
Potential partners would be the street watch scheme as well as 'safer space/haven' imitative.
An increase in uniformed patrols and volunteers from the local community to provide a visible presence and deterrent.
