<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-10</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY:

To reduce knife-enabled watch robberies in the streets surrounding Brompton Road and Sloane Street.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police.

This can be achieved by operations targeting robbery hotspot areas, high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening - crime prevention advice and engagement via social media.

This issue has historically been prevalent across AW BCU, and previous years have seen the number of offences rising in the warmer summer months, when victim's watches are more likely to be visible. A number of these offences have received viral coverage on social media, and this type of crime continues to be a matter of concern for Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).
</issue><issue-date>2024-10-10</issue-date><action>Proactive and plain clothes operations have been carried out across the AW BCU involving officers from specialist police units, which have resulted in the arrest of a number of suspects for watch robbery offences.

Officers have also been running regular crime prevention stands, such as the 'Look up, look out' campaign.</action><action-date>2024-10-10</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-10</suggestion-date><issue>To reduce Theft From Motor Vehicle offences in Hans Place, Egerton Gardens and Lowndes Square.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, plain-clothes deployments in conjunction with pursuit-trained units, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through crime prevention advice via social media/leaflet drops and working with RBKandC Council to install signage/CCTV on affected streets.

The number of these type of offences has previously peaked over the winter months, leading up to and following on from Christmas. Crime figures show that current levels have reduced by around 50% since Winter 2023, however it is still one of the most prevalent offences on the ward. This concern is shared by Ward Panel members.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).</issue><issue-date>2024-10-10</issue-date><action>Proactive patrols carried out over the past 6 months as part of Op LUBBOCHI.

This can be measured by the number of such crimes reported to police in these areas.

This can be achieved by high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening through effective use of cocooning visits, crime prevention advice via social media and face-to-face community engagement events.

This number of these type of offences has previously risen over the summer months, when some homes are unoccupied with people away on holiday, and windows left open due to warmer weather. Historically this type of crime also tends to increase in the months leading up to Christmas.

This will be measured and reviewed at the next Ward Panel meeting (every three months).

We have also gone into IBIS, Double Tree and Moxy and dropped off some VAWG leaflets to leave in their waiting area. When giving these hotels the leaflets I spoke to them about any VAWG offences that have taken place in their hotel and they said they only get a small percentage of them.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-06-11</suggestion-date><issue>With incidents of violent crime on Eastbrook and Rush Green among the borough’s lowest, the team have continued to make efforts to further improve the ward’s safety. Open space patrols have been increased, partly in line with the team’s priority focusing on ASB in Central Park, with the Eastbrookend Country Park and Nature Reserve, along with Fels Field and Footpath 18, receiving additional coverage.</issue><issue-date>2024-06-11</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-06-11</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Open space ASB/reassurance</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-06-11</suggestion-date><issue>The Eastbrookend Country Park and Central Park will be among the ward's green spaces covered more extensively over the next 3 months as a newly-elected priority set during June’s Ward Panel Meeting (WPM). With summer set to attract an increase in visitors, the team will look to limit opportunities for anti-social behaviour (ASB) and maintain a high level of safety, incorporating Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG), across Eastbrook and Rush Green’s open spaces. The conclusion of March’s WPM saw heightened coverage around Central Park to monitor two-wheeled vehicle ASB and this will continue under the new widened commitment. Recent months have also seen a number of foot patrols around the country park, with one taking in over 2.4 miles of the 84-hectare site.

Strategies for combating vehicle theft will include visiting residents hyperlocal to incidents and those who own same-type vehicles to those being targeted. A similar approach was taken between 2019-2021, which saw 478 visits across the ward, with 87 Ford Fiesta, 46 BMW and 20 Range Rover owners among those provided advice. A methodical measure will also be used to remove opportunities for theft from vehicle offences, including a ‘car-by-car’ approach to identify  items of potential value left on display. A day in April this year saw 246 vehicles checked, while July 2020 recorded 470 checks in a single day, including 316 on Parish Fields. On the latter occasion, 11 items of potential value were noted and brought to the attention of the owners. </issue><issue-date>2024-06-11</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-06-11</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-08-09</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and drugs - Feltham Park
Tackle drugs activity and robberies in and around the area of Feltham Parks and look to reduce and prevent it where possible.
The team were able to identify a group of three robbers who were subsequently arrested and charged. We then stopped and detained a different group of three other robbers who were also arrested. 
There were a large number of gang nominal who had recently been travelling to Feltham Parks and loitering there in groups. They have been selling both class A drugs as well as cannabis and are armed with large hunting knives. We have focused our efforts on identifying as many nominal involved in this activity as possible to help us build accurate and useful intelligence and have arrested subjects when it has been safe to do so.
Most recently one of the males arrested is now currently in prison after an arrest by the team, another was arrested when found with class A drugs and a third was arrested for weapons offensives. 
The team is also utilising CBOs, CPNS and ASB warning notices to disrupt these gang nominal by restricting which locations they can visit and who they can associate with, which so far is proving to be effective.</issue><issue-date>2024-08-09</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-08-09</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Antisocial behaviour in North Feltham</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-08-09</suggestion-date><issue>The team will focus their efforts in reducing antisocial behaviour on the ward by identifying groups and individuals involved in causing this.

We regularly stop e-scooter riders when it is safe to do so and have seized several, as well as issuing section 59 warnings when appropriate. This has the added bonus of further disrupting drug dealers, as the vehicle proves to be popular mode of transport for them.
Reports of motorcycles being ridden antisocially have reduced considerably. The team still patrol the areas where these are likely to be used.</issue><issue-date>2024-08-09</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-08-09</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-03</suggestion-date><issue>Robbery and burglary
To reduce incidents of Robbery and burglary in the Earl’s Court area.
Measurable: the incidences of robbery and burglary can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, and ASB reports relating to robbery and attempted robbery.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by the continuation of high-visibility foot and cycle patrols, vehicle patrols, variation of shifts to include late and night shifts, targeted use of stop and search tactics, and target hardening. We also provide crime prevention advice and engagement via social media. Earl’s Court SNT officers regularly change their shifts to combat robbery and burglary, and conduct stop and search where grounds exist.  Robbery and burglary patrols are conducted on the Earls Court Road and surrounding streets. The Earls Court ward panel members are often given crime prevention advice regarding knife point robberies.   
Plain clothes operations can be considered with neighbouring wards to further disrupt robbery if need be.</issue><issue-date>2024-10-03</issue-date><action>SNT conduct regular proactive patrols around the ward at all times of the day.

Measurable: this can be monitored by the number of ASB calls, crime reports, intelligence reports, and ASB reports relating to drugs, as well as the anecdotal evidence seen by officers, WP members and local residents.
Achievable and realistic: this can be achieved by a combination of high-visibility patrols within the highlighted area, joint working with RBKC wardens officers, robust enforcement of PSPO legislation and effective use of CPW/CPN to  offenders. Earl’s Court officers have been proactive in obtaining two very successful warrants recently, recovering approx. £30,000 of drugs. Drug users have reported that the area is currently ‘too hot’ for drugs and they are going elsewhere. Local drug users are regularly stopped and searched, leading to a number of arrests and community resolutions. The drug hotspots in Earls Court are around Nevern Square, Nevern Place, Trebovir Road and Templeton Place. These areas are patrolled when officers are on duty. Further drug warrants are planned to combat the supply of drugs in Earls Court.</issue><issue-date>2024-10-03</issue-date><action>SNT approach drug issues using a multi pronged approach.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-09-22</suggestion-date><issue>Drug related gang violence
This priority is aimed at reducing the street robberies in and around the Winstanley Estate area. In particular, any streets or public greens such as York Gardens which serve as a thoroughfare for commuters egressing from Clapham Junction who may find themselves as victims of personal robbery, in particular during the hours of darkness later in the year.
Ongoing patrols where our late turn shifts allow serve as a good point to deal with this.
In addition, utilising support from other resources and teams such as the new Neighbourhood Tasking Team, and the Territorial Support Group will assist us in dealing with such issues.</issue><issue-date>2024-09-22</issue-date><action>Research of intelligence system to identify locations for patrols and potential offenders.

This is not bespoke to one particular area of our ward, instead it is found to exist in multiple areas across Latchmere.
Will will map out each crime using Met Insights / PlanWeb, and using this data, we will be able to work out hotspots and as such, co-ordinate patrols effectively.
When at each hotspot, and circumstance permitting, good use of Stop and Search, and where applicable, good use of the information sharing agreement with the council may assist in dealing with those most troublesome.
ASB comes in many form - such as, noise disturbances from addresses engaged in drug dealing, loitering in and around these areas thus putting neighbours in fear of harm, urination / defecation in stairwells and other public access areas of buildings, graffiti. The list is non exhaustive.
Where we identify addresses that are causing ASB issues and where drugs are the nucleus, we can use ASB powers to good use - such as Closure Orders under Section 80 of the ASB Act of 2014.</issue><issue-date>2024-09-22</issue-date><action>High Visibility patrols to the locations identified to deter those committing Anti-Social Behaviour.

SPECIFIC: Reduce the fear of assaults by members of the public in public places across Barkingside. To also gain public confidence in local Policing. 

MEASURABLE: Success can be measured by the declination of number of reported incidents to Police and positive feedback during community events and engagements with members of the community. This enables Police to seek community opinions, concerns and queries regarding the hotspot areas mentioned in the latter.

ACHIEVABLE: Ensure members of the community feel safe and can safely use the locations. Focus is on working with the community including other agencies such as TFL and Redbridge Enforcement, carry out high Vis and plain clothes patrols, VAWG walk and talks, community contact session and stalls set up in busy areas. 
RELEVANT: Ensure members of the community can safely use the public locations and the public subway. 

TIMELY: The period between ward panel meetings will be used to monitor the success of this problem-solving process. Resources will also be taken into consideration, Review to take place prior to ward panel meetings which are held 4 times per year. Surveys are also sent out to ward residents to obtain opinions or concerns that are used to monitor success rates of neighbourhood policing.

Officers were deployed to several streets on the peripheral roads to the town centre where a speed gun was utilised. Several motorists engaged with and thankfully no offences noted by the team.

The Hounslow Central and East wards include vicinities around the Hounslow Town Centre and include areas of high footfall throughout the day and night. There are a vast number of shops, restaurants, and transport networks, and we see a big presence of delivery riders on both cycles and mopeds. 
Pedal Bicycles (Safety) Regulations 2010 - Bicycles must be sold with a bell, though bells do not have to be fitted to a bike thereafter. We want to encourage the installation and utilisation of bells.
Unless there are cycle lanes which you would prefer to use, cyclists should always use the roads. This is because they are a lot faster than pedestrians, which makes them a hazard to them.

This area has seen increased robberies in recent months. We will work in partnership with the college to reduce these offences which have predominantly impacted young people and will restore the public’s confidence in being able to use these shared spaces safely. 
In order to achieve this we will conduct patrols in partnership with the local authority as well as working in collaboration with the college to provide crime prevention sessions with the students. We will use a data driven approach to inform our patrols and tactics to combat this type of crime.
We will hold ourselves accountable using the MPS published crime figures for this area.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-13</suggestion-date><issue>Kenton SNT insist that all public open spaces will be a safe place for all. Whether this be protecting public in relation to VAWG offences, or ensuring the PSPO is adhered to, and anti social behaviour dealt with robustly. To achieve this, we aim to decrease drug and alcohol use and drug dealing (including through use of cars, mopeds, e-scooters, and bicycles in an around all public parks and recreational grounds. A recurring trend during ward panel meetings is residence and school children feeling unsafe to enter public spaces, and we insist this must not be the case.  </issue><issue-date>2024-10-13</issue-date><action>1 – Kenton and Preston SNT have carried out and will continue to carry out proactive patrols in parks and open spaces through-out Kenton. These patrols have increased and the results are reflective of this. In one park alone in a single day, 3 cannabis detections were made within the space of a few hours. These patrols will continue, with the aim of identifying the offenders, and letting them know that Kenton open spaces are not the places from criminal and anti-social activity. 
2 – Kenton will be increasing their surgeries and community contact sessions being held in parks and open spaces, allowing residence to attend and speak with their local bobbies. 
3 – Kenton SNT have assisted the ward panel chair to achieve a suitable outcome, of the demolition of Lidding Road garages, a hotspot for anti-social and illegal activity, spilling out into the Woodcock Park open space.  
4 – Kenton and Preston have made a number of changes to their shifts to be available and present during times where anti-social and illegal activity is known to peak during twilight hours. 
5 – We will be holding at least once a month a dedicated VAWG contact session, where we will encourage people to come forward with concerns or questions and be offering advice where possible. No one should feel unsafe.</action><action-date>2024-10-13</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Targeting excessive speed and the anti-social use of vehicles, including their use in violence enabling crime. </suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-13</suggestion-date><issue>Concerned residents have raised that there seems to be a concerning level of excess speed within the Kenton Road area, and the anti-social use of vehicles across the ward. This includes dangerous vehicle driving in private carparks, the use of vehicle on foot paths and through pedestrian gates, and the general use of vehicles in crime, including drug dealing, robberies and burglaries. </issue><issue-date>2024-10-13</issue-date><action>1 – Kenton SNT take a zero tolerance approach to the anti social use of vehicles.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-03</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERIES
S. To reduce the amount of robberies on residential streets across the ward. 

M. SNT Analytics shows a large amount of robberies happen near to Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road. This is due to residents/non-residents attending the area and visiting local bars and restaurant’s. Members of public are then normally targeted walking home from venues in off streets from the main roads.

A. Though Plain Cloths operations and adjusting shifts to match the pattern of times these offences occur, officers can look to target those committing these crimes. A mobile CCTV camera has been requested from the council and placed on the junction of Old Brompton Road and Drayton Gardens to tackle the issue. Through the day local ward officers will conduct high vis patrols giving crime prevention around hotspot locations (Creswell Place and Redcliffe Gardens).

R. Robberies appears to be an opportunistic crime on the ward, however is also seen to occur on roads that lack CCTV, or have poor coverage. 

T. To be reviewed at the next ward panel meeting.

Statistic’s are showing a slight rise in high value residential Burglaries, which are being targeted. Entrance through windows is common place by force using blunt tools....and using scaffolding to access neighbours..
 ***Garage burglaries have shown an increase***
SMART:-
Specific  –  Prevent and Reduce burglaries on the whole ward.
Measurable – Measure through, statistic crime reports, trend mapping and calls to police (Crimes recorded).
Achievable – Attained through preventative high visibility patrols in key areas / Cocooning /Social media posts /Crime prevention.
Relevant – Due to the personal nature of the crime this is a top ward priority. Summer conditions, increases burglary activity.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-06</suggestion-date><issue>1 Robbery
The local team will prioritise robberies following a few offences being recorded over the previous quarter. 
All allegations of robbery within the ward will be attended, local enquiries with possible witnesses and CCTV will be pursued to assist in the investigation
Where possible, contact will be maintained with victims to ensure they are supported through the process
Any suspects will be targeted through ‘Achilles Heel’ tactics for other offences in order to deter these offenders.
Patrols will be completed in areas identified at high risk where possible to deter offenders
Stop and search will be used where intelligence supports action to detect people carrying weapons and stolen property
The team will engage with the Priority Crime Unit to support their investigations where possible
The success of the work will be based on the number of offences recorded between 6/03/2024 and 5/6/2024
These actions are achievable with prioritisation, however some will require the assistance of other teams and units
This is relevant due to the increased number of offences and the nature of the offence
The priority will be reviewed on 5th June 2024 at the next ward panel meeting
</issue><issue-date>2024-10-06</issue-date><action></action><action-date>2024-10-06</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drug Dealing</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-06</suggestion-date><issue>The local team will focus on drug use and supply, specifically targeting to disrupt users and supply of drugs. This will be achieved through concentration of Hot spot areas identified to us around Rayners Lane Estate, Newton Farm Ecology Park and the surrounding streets. Drugs users found in possession of drugs paraphernalia but not substance will be issued with Community Protection Notice Warnings (CPNW’s) in order to prohibit anti-social behaviour. Any breaches will be dealt with robustly.
Premises with closure orders will be monitored to ensure that they no longer attract drug users and keep the users visible on the streets to allow them to be dealt with by CPNW.
A Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) will be considered in any conviction following breaches of CPN’s to give long term solutions
Drug users are believed to be influencing a spike in theft from motor vehicle offences and motor vehicle interference offences, this also fuels violent crime through the supply of drugs and disputes over territory around supply areas.
This will be measured as quantifiable results for searches of persons, premises and vehicles for drugs, CPNW’s issued and breaches of closures orders.
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

This covers a wide range of issues including tipping, littering, spitting, breaches of the public space protection order and noise issues.
The local ward team will triage allegations of ASB in the community which are reported to police. The team will work with Kingdom Security and ensure coverage of the ward when the ward team are not on duty is maximised using these other resources to address these concerns. Persons identified as causing ASB will be engaged with and where the evidence supports, issued with prohibitions under community protection legislation to address these behaviours. The police will continue to refer incidents of tipping to the local authority and assist where necessary in progressing their investigations into these offences.
This will be measured by collating the number of ASB allegations which are made to police and the relevant interventions that are introduced by police.
The ward team are actively involved in reducing ASB as part of our core duties and therefore with some intensification, this should be achievable
This priority has been set by the Ward Panel members and therefore is relevant
Actions to be collated after 3 months and referred to the panel on 5th June 2024 for review

2 – Proactive operations have been carried out in the area, leading to multiple arrests. 
3 – Problematic residence of the area have been approached by the ward officers and sergeant and concerns regarding their behaviour have been highlighted. Possible repercussions of continued negative behaviour have been suggested. 
4 – A closure order has been put in place and has been running for nearly 3 months at the time of this update. Since the closure has been in place complaints from residents have drastically decreased and a recent visit has suggested that residents are happy with the closure and the positive effect it has had. Preston SNT are working hard to have this extended and further updates will be added. Hirst crescent no longer seems to be an ASB hotspot.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-06</suggestion-date><issue>ROBBERY – Violence Related Priority

Ward Priority 1 - Violence 
This is the MPS priority set in the ward panel.
The local ward police team will dedicate focus on a greater awareness of Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG).
The police will specifically conduct proactive engagement with the relevant demographics and other demographics who wish to highlight issues. A minimum of two events will be held within the ward and one of these will operate in the vicinity of Rayners Lane Tube Station.
The team will gather relevant information about where people feel unsafe and also address the perception of crime. A comprehensive intelligence and information picture will be developed over the period which will be presented to the ward panel and will be analysed to establish if there are available interventions
This process is intended to better understand the problem, previous interactions of this nature have been well received and well attended and therefore this should be achievable
This links to violence and the fear of violence, it is therefore relevant
This engagement will commence for three months and should be sufficient time to develop an understanding of local issues
</issue><issue-date>2024-10-06</issue-date><action>Rayners Lane SNT PC's and PCSO have conducted regular mobile and foot patrols across the ward during various times of the day. We have completed daily weapons sweeps at various locations especially at hot spots, such as service roads on ALEXANDRA AVENUE and concealed staircases.
 
Operation GOODRICH: Local ward officers have been patrolling RAYNERS LANE STATION to engage with girls and women to make them aware about the VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) and issue literature, give advice and encourage women and girls to report any unsafe streets on STREET SAFE.
</action><action-date>2024-10-06</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Ward Priority 2 - Substance Abuse</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-10-06</suggestion-date><issue>The SNT will target offenders abusing substances in the ward, utilising Achilles heels tactics to disrupt and deter offending, including use of the Public Space Protection Order.
Where intelligence is received about supply or use, the team will actively use all powers available to disrupt these offenders and obtain evidence of these offences.
Officers will continue to engage with the community to identify areas where these issues are prevalent, including engaging with local businesses and enforcing licence conditions for the sale of alcohol.

The SNT will record encounters and present these results to the ward panel 

Officers will be present in the community and come across issues for substance abuse, paying specific attention to these problems will make this goal achievable.

This has been sighted as an issue on the survey and by the ward panel and therefore it is relevant

This priority has been set for 3 months and will be reviewed at the next Ward panel meeting on 04/05/2024
</issue><issue-date>2024-10-06</issue-date><action>Patrols in area known for the most drug use, such as, Alexander Avenue and Rayner Lane and Community Protection Warnings and Community Protection Notices will be issued to nominals known to police for drug. 
Research and intelligence gathering underway for consideration of targeted individuals and addresses for enforcement action.

Officers found insecure gate inside the building where you can simply use your hand to open the gate lock from the opposite end. There were drug paraphernalia and evidence of rough sleeping. SNT have notified Housing association to immediately secure the gate properly and to clean area. Hopefully this will reduce ASB in the area. 

SNT officers checked the area and confirmed that local housing had secured the stairway gate with a padlock lock. They also removed all belongings from the underground parking area. There were no issues found with rough sleepers. Local SNT will perform reassurance visit of the stairwells and near to the address going forward. In addition, we are working together with the local housing association to identify and assist homeless individuals especially in the winter.

A Over the last six months, there have been several incidents linked to serious violence thereby causing GBH level injuries to the victim. Although on almost every occasion the victims have declined to substantiate the allegation or have refused to provide details or description of the alleged suspects, intelligence states this might be linked to gang related violence over drugs or previous incidents.

ASB is low in the area and when it does occur, it is often attributed to the street population around the Lillington and Longmore estate and around Victoria train Station. Last quarter this had spread to adjacent areas but concentrated patrols appears to have reduced this. However reports of drug taking in private gardens and cellar areas still raises it head. Begging, drug taking, drug paraphernalia, rubbish being left are all symptoms of the street population and will be targeted by local officers. Problem Solving will take place working with the local charities and support services alongside neighbourhood coordinators and speaking to the residents to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available. We will be receiving support from our Local Policing teams such as The Violence Suppression unit and Gangs Unit, who can add extra numbers and skills to have an impact on resident’s concerns.</issue><issue-date>2024-10-03</issue-date><action>Heightened patrols will take place at targeted times and locations in order to target the issue. The use of community protection notices will continue, targeting those engaging in anti-social behaviour. We will work alongside our partners, including the VBID, Homeless charities and above all, Hopkinson House. Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any signs of potential drug dealing, no matter how small it may seem. If any community members would also like to be part of a walk-along patrol to discuss this issue, please use the contact forms on this site. Local officers  will continue to work with  both internal policing units such as the Territorial Support Group who support Local Policing within their crime focused weeks on areas throughout London and other police forces such as the City of London Police and British Transport Police to conduct joint operations focusing on areas known as drug hotspots and attempting to disrupt county lines.

Levels of violent offences are low in Sydenham particularly outside of domestic settings.
From local knowledge from informal reports the Sydenham High Street during darkness is the area in which people feel least safe.
SNT officers will engage with members of the public to encourage the use of the Street Safe tool to anonymously record the areas of Sydenham in which they feel least safe and why.
This approach and any data gathered will be reviewed by 29/11/2024.

The Nugent Retail Park in SMC is known as a hotpot for shoplifting offences and is a significant crime generator. With a large number of retail outlets, the area is frequented by prolific, priority offenders, known to police to be drug dependent who often offend to fund their addiction.

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) - VILLIERS STREET, DOVER STREET and BERKELEY STREET
Concerns were raised about safety of women and girls within the West End. This is specific to issues of drink spiking and sexual assault in the night time economy. Crime reports have identify Night Time entertainment venues . Police will increase engagement and awareness events to engage and educate venue staff members/security  to ensure they are aware how to appropriately react if a crime has been committed. Also how to advise customers of issues / safety. This issue won’t be resolved completely but regular engagement with females who work and live on the ward can help broaden our understanding of where the problem areas are through Walk and Talk events and other engagement strategies.  We will provide awareness training liaising with open venues about ask for Angela and noticing signs of vulnerability.</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>ACTIONS: 
Increase high visibility patrols in the evening and night. Advertise walk and talks to engage with female members of the public who frequent in the ward or live there. Actively engage with the clubs in the ward to ensure they are up to date with training on how to protect women and girls. We will ensure hi-visibility patrols continue outside venues and around hotspot locations identified by regular analysis of Crime data. 
Have officers from our WEPT and TSG conduct static patrols surrounding our hot spot areas during the peak times for robbery.  Review the location of the offences where this is happening and consider Design Out options to prevent this crime from occurring in the first place.  Check that there is enough CCTV coverage of the hotspot areas so that evidence of the crimes can be captured and lead to successful prosecutions.</action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Theft From Motor Vehicle and theft of pedal cycle - St James Square and LSE</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Theft from Motor Vehicle in the above location.
There has been an increase in theft from motor vehicle and vehicle related ASB within the St James Ward. In the build up to Christmas there will be a correlating increase in theft from motor vehicles in multi-storey carparks and locations such as Green Street in Mayfair. In response there will be an increase in High-visibility patrols in areas identified as hotspot locations, this will be coupled with a leafletting and poster campaign. Car park venues will be visited and crime prevention measures will be discussed with the operators and staff on site. Ward social media will be used to increase coverage of these campaigns. Groups entering into the ward footprint for ASB related activity will be targeted via the MO8 task force, established acoustic camera coverage and increasing the use of evidence gathered by MOP in taking enforcement action against the vehicles and drivers. 

</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increase patrols in the identified hotspot locations, encourage use of police bicycles to deter thefts by individuals on bicycles, cover a wider area and increase frequency of officers in the area. Increase the number of social media posts relating to vehicle related crime in the build up to Christmas. </action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>ASB - Berkeley Square, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and Bow Street</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-11-02</suggestion-date><issue>Begging, congregating in groups around the restaurants/cafes in Berkeley Sq
Residents in Mayfair and St James have told local officers that they have seen an increase in beggars along Piccadilly and Berkeley Street. They have stated that they are constantly asking for money and sometimes when refused they can get aggressive to members of the public. In response to these problems local officers will complete days of action, whereby a day will be spent making those beggars aware that it is against the law to beg. For those who are genuinely sleeping rough and require help, we will work with multiple welfare agencies and refer them to the most appropriate one if they require help or support. If they are found begging following this work, they will be issued with a community written warnings and notices to enforce against the problem. Partnership working with the Westminster Council will also take place to issue tickets to those that are engaging in illegal street trading. The aim will be to work with the street engagement team and immigration for persistent beggars reducing the issues for the community.</issue><issue-date>2023-11-02</issue-date><action>Actions:
Increased and targeted patrols around the most affected streets, complete patrols at peak times of begging. Partners have been engaged for welfare services to those that do not want to be sleeping rough. 
Have so far completed the first phase of this action by warning those about begging. The next action is starting issuing warnings</action><action-date>2023-11-02</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-12-29</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has been identified as a repeat area for robbery occurring in the West End. Soho is a small area relative to other wards in the area, it has a bustling night time economy which many thousands of people come to, primarily over the weekends. Robbery in Soho is mainly fuelled by the night time economy. Intoxicated patrons leaving bars, clubs, and pubs become targets for groups and individuals intent on stealing their personal property. It is a concern of Soho residents and visitors alike, as robbery is a highly invasive and distressing crime to become victim of. The Met has tasked pan-London units to patrol in Soho to combat these violent offences. The West End Proactive Partnership Team is the West End’s dedicated team of officers that are out on foot patrol covering the night time economy. They continue to actively target robbery suspects.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Proactive teams from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group have already been conducting targeted patrols around Soho. This has seen numerous arrests for robbery and related offences, and disrupting those suspected of being involved in violent offences. Officers in Soho will continue to proactively identify offenders and stop robberies from occurring. Using evidence based approaches, targeting specific roads where the majority of offences are known to occur. High visibility patrols will continue to provide reassurance to members of the public, and provide both reactive and proactive elements in combating robbery, so officers are able to quickly attend calls in Soho. Local Ward officers will be hosting crime prevention stalls, and engagement events in busy areas of Soho which anyone is welcome to attend.</action><action-date>2023-12-29</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion>Drugs</suggestion><suggestion-date>2023-12-29</suggestion-date><issue>Soho has seen sporadic but concentrated issues surrounding the blatant use of drugs on the streets. Several areas in Soho have repeatedly had issues with drug users congregating in areas with low foot traffic, doorways and poorly lit areas. Officers are aware and engaging with drug users, who the majority of are vulnerable or living on the streets. Officers have worked alongside the council and outreach services in order to take a longer term non-enforcement action, which in the long run will produce better more time efficient results as opposed to constantly arresting offenders. Some users/offenders are not engaging well with the diversion and assistance routes offered to them so enforcement action will be taken.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Officers will continue to carry out proactive targeted patrols to problem areas at the times of day identified by residents. Officers to better utilise their stop and search powers coupled with solid information and intelligence submitted by residents and victims of Anti-Social Behaviour. Officers will also continue to make referrals to outreach services to those willing to engage. Officers will be issuing CPWs, CPN,s and eventually CBOs to prolific offenders that cause anti-social behaviour through the use of drugs. For residents, please submit information reports through official Met reporting channels as this information will get filtered to us, and we will use this information to proactively target anti-social behaviour hotspots.

They were concerned that PEDICABS are all coming together and parking their Pedi cabs mainly outside Hippodrome Casino. In response to this officers from the local team will perform targeted patrols over the next three months specifically looking at this issue. Problem Solving will take place working with Westminster Council and Wept team to further reduce long term impact of this problem where appropriate and available.</issue><issue-date>2023-12-29</issue-date><action>Targeted patrols took place at different times, resulting in a number of CPN’s and community resolution for Pedi cabs. In addition, Officers will continue to find innovative ways to tackle this problem over the following month to ensure no reoccurrence, but we ask the public to report any issues with Pedi cabs, no matter how small it may seem. There have been a decrease of Pedi cabs in the area due to the approach officers and Westminster council have taken.</action><action-date>2023-12-29</action-date></priority></priorities>

<priorities><priority><suggestion>Violence Related Priority</suggestion><suggestion-date>2024-04-18</suggestion-date><issue>Reducing Violent Crime ( Robbery/ VAWG) 
In line with MET policy. Reducing Robberies along Chamberlayne Road.
To work in partnership with local community members and schools as a high proportion of robbery victims are of school age.
It had been reported that robberies were occurring along Chamberlayne Road mostly between the hours of 1500 -1700 hrs Monday to Friday and that the victims are of school age.
School children like to have the latest mobile phones or trainers for example which therefore makes them an easy target.  Also things such as not being aware to keep personal items out of sight when walking from school (air pods, watches, jewellery)
Potential partners would be the street watch scheme as well as 'safer space/haven' imitative.
It's a busy main road with a local bus hub and the main exit route from Queens Park community school.
An increase in uniformed patrols and volunteers from the local community to provide a visible presence and deterrent.
S - Robbery offences 
M - Crime figures will show levels of crime and timescale 
A -  Suspect can be identified and arrested thus prevent further offences
